Please understand the requirement and write a rough solving process. It starts with a input-output structure. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops. The necessary details should be written in natural languages.
And you'll need to put [BEGIN] before your solution and [DONE] after it.

[BEGIN]
Input: str: a string 
Output: ch: a repeated character in str 
1: 	for each character ch in str: 
2: 		if ch appears more than once in str: 
3: 			return ch 
4: 	return None
[DONE]
