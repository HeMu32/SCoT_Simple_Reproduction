Input: test_list: a list of tuples, K: an integer representing the index
Output: res: the product of the Kth index elements in the tuples

1: Initialize res to 1
2: Create a list comprehension to:
3:     For each sub-tuple in test_list:
4:         Extract the element at index K
5: Pass the list of extracted elements to get_product function
6: In get_product function:
7:     For each element in the passed list:
8:         Multiply res by the element
9: Return res from get_product function
10: Return the result from get_product function as the final output
