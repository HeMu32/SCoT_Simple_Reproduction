Input: arr: a list of Pair objects, n: the number of pairs in arr
Output: max: the length of the longest chain that can be formed from the pairs

1: Initialize max to 0
2: Initialize a list mcl of length n with all elements set to 1
3: for i from 1 to n-1 do
4:     for j from 0 to i-1 do
5:         if arr[i].a > arr[j].b and mcl[i] < mcl[j] + 1 then
6:             set mcl[i] to mcl[j] + 1
7: for i from 0 to n-1 do
8:     if max < mcl[i] then
9:         set max to mcl[i]
10: return max
