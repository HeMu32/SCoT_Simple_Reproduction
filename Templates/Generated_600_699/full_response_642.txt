Input: test_list: a list of tuples representing a matrix
Output: res: a set of tuples with similar rows removed

1: Initialize an empty list to store the processed rows
2: For each row (sub) in test_list:
3:     Convert the row to a set to remove duplicate elements within the row
4:     Sort the set to ensure the elements are in a consistent order
5:     Convert the sorted set back to a tuple
6:     Append the processed tuple to the list from step 1
7: Convert the list of processed tuples to a set to remove duplicate rows
8: Return the set of unique rows
