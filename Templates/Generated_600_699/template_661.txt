Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list
Output: max_sum: the maximum sum that can be formed which has no three consecutive elements present

1: Initialize a list `sum` of length `n` with all elements set to 0.
2: If `n` is greater than or equal to 1:
3:     Set `sum[0]` to `arr[0]`.
4: If `n` is greater than or equal to 2:
5:     Set `sum[1]` to the sum of `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.
6: If `n` is greater than 2:
7:     Set `sum[2]` to the maximum of `sum[1]`, `arr[1] + arr[2]`, and `arr[0] + arr[2]`.
8: For each index `i` from 3 to `n-1`:
9:     Set `sum[i]` to the maximum of:
10:        - `sum[i-1]` (excluding the current element)
11:        - `sum[i-2] + arr[i]` (including the current element but not the previous one)
12:        - `arr[i] + arr[i-1] + sum[i-3]` (including the current element and the previous one, but not the one before that)
13: Return `sum[n-1]` as the maximum sum.
