Input: a, b: two integers
Output: gcd: the greatest common divisor of a and b
1: Determine the smaller number (low) and the larger number (high) between a and b
2: If low is 0:
3:     Return high as the gcd
4: Else if low is 1:
5:     Return 1 as the gcd
6: Else:
7:     Recursively call the function with low and the remainder of high divided by low
8:     Return the result of the recursive call
