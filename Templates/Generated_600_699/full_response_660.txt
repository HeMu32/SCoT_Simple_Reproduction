[BEGIN]
Input: l1, r1, l2, r2: integers representing the start and end of two ranges.
Output: (x, y): a tuple of integers where x and y are points chosen from the two ranges such that no point lies in both ranges. If no such points exist, return (-1, -1).

1: Set x to the minimum of l1 and l2 if l1 is not equal to l2; otherwise, set x to -1.
2: Set y to the maximum of r1 and r2 if r1 is not equal to r2; otherwise, set y to -1.
3: Return the tuple (x, y).
