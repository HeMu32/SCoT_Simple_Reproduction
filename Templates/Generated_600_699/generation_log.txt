Solution:
def first_Repeated_Char(str): 
	h = {} 
	for ch in str: 
		if ch in h: 
			return ch; 
		else: 
			h[ch] = 0 
		return None

Here's another example:

Requirement:
'''python
def monotonic (str)
	"""
	Complete this method, return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
	"""
	Pass

2: 		if the element is greater than its previous element then 
3: 			l increases 
4: 		if the element is less than its previous element then 
5: 			l decreases 
6: 	if both increase and decrease then 
7: 		return False 
8: 	else

'''

You'll need to summarize the solution code as a procedure, similar to the examples above. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops.
The necessary details should be written in natural languages. And mind your indentation accroading to code logic.
Do not touch specific implementation details, just like in examples.
Please put [BEGIN] before your procedure and [END] after it. You don't need to put "Prucedure" at the beginning.

You'll need to summarize the solution code as a procedure, similar to the examples above. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops.
The necessary details should be written in natural languages. And mind your indentation accroading to code logic.

You are an expert Python programmer. I need you to analyze a programming problem and provide a step-by-step solution procedure.

Here's an example of what I'm looking for:

Requirement:
'''python

Output: ch: a repeated character in str 
1: for each character ch in str: 
2: 		if ch appears more than once in str: 
3: 		return ch 
4: return None 


Solution:
def first_Repeated_Char(str): 
	h = {} 
	for ch in str: 
		if ch in h: 
			return ch; 
		else: 
			h[ch] = 0 
		return None

Here's another example:

Requirement:
'''python
def monotonic (str)
	"""
	Complete this method, return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
	"""
	Pass
'''


Procedure:
Input: l: list 
Output: True or False 
1: 	for each element in l do 
2: 		if the element is greater than its previous element then 
3: 			l increases 
4: 		if the element is less than its previous element then 
5: 			l decreases 
6: 	if both increase and decrease then 
7: 		return False 
8: 	else 
9: 		return True 


Solution:
def monotonic(l: list): 
	increasing = False 
	decreasing = False 
	for i in range(1, len(l)): 
		if l[i] > l[i-1]: 
			increasing = True 
		if l[i] < l[i-1]: 
			decreasing = True 
	if increasing and decreasing: 
		return False 
	else: return True

Now, I want you to analyze the following problem:

Requirement:
'''python
def largest_subset(a, n)
	"""
	Write a function to find the largest subset where each pair is divisible.
	"""
	Pass
'''

Here's the solution code for this problem:
'''python
def largest_subset(a, n):
	dp = [0 for i in range(n)]
	dp[n - 1] = 1; 
	for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
		mxm = 0;
		for j in range(i + 1, n):
			if a[j] % a[i] == 0 or a[i] % a[j] == 0:
				mxm = max(mxm, dp[j])
		dp[i] = 1 + mxm
	return max(dp)
'''

You'll need to summarize the solution code as a procedure, similar to the examples above. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops.
The necessary details should be written in natural languages. And mind your indentation accroading to code logic.
Do not touch specific implementation details, just like in examples.
Please put [BEGIN] before your procedure and [END] after it. You don't need to put "Prucedure" at the beginning.

'''

You'll need to summarize the solution code as a procedure, similar to the examples above. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops.
The necessary details should be written in natural languages. And mind your indentation accroading to code logic.
Do not touch specific implementation details, just like in examples.
Please put [BEGIN] before your procedure and [END] after it. You don't need to put "Prucedure" at the beginning.

You'll need to summarize the solution code as a procedure, similar to the examples above. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops.
The necessary details should be written in natural languages. And mind your indentation accroading to code logic.
Do not touch specific implementation details, just like in examples.
Please put [BEGIN] before your procedure and [END] after it. You don't need to put "Prucedure" at the beginning.

You'll need to summarize the solution code as a procedure, similar to the examples above. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops.
The necessary details should be written in natural languages. And mind your indentation accroading to code logic.
Do not touch specific implementation details, just like in examples.
Please put [BEGIN] before your procedure and [END] after it. You don't need to put "Prucedure" at the beginning.

You are an expert Python programmer. I need you to analyze a programming problem and provide a step-by-step solution procedure.

Here's an example of what I'm looking for:

Requirement:

def first_Repeated_Char(str): 
	h = {} 
	for ch in str: 
		if ch in h: 
			return ch; 
		else: 
			h[ch] = 0 
		return None

Here's another example:

Requirement:
'''python
def monotonic (str)
	"""
	Complete this method, return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.

Procedure:

2: 		if the element is greater than its previous element then 
3: 			l increases 
4: 		if the element is less than its previous element then 
5: 			l decreases 
6: 	if both increase and decrease then

	else: return True

Now, I want you to analyze the following problem:

Requirement:
'''python
def Repeat(x)
	"""
	Write a python function to print duplicants from a list of integers.

	Pass
'''

Here's the solution code for this problem:

    repeated = [] 
    for i in range(_size): 
        k = i + 1

                repeated.append(x[i]) 
    return repeated 
'''

You'll need to summarize the solution code as a procedure, similar to the examples above. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops.
The necessary details should be written in natural languages. And mind your indentation accroading to code logic.
Do not touch specific implementation details, just like in examples.
Please put [BEGIN] before your procedure and [END] after it. You don't need to put "Prucedure" at the beginning.

You are an expert Python programmer. I need you to analyze a programming problem and provide a step-by-step solution procedure.

Here's an example of what I'm looking for:

Output: ch: a repeated character in str 
1: for each character ch in str:

4: return None 


Solution:
def first_Repeated_Char(str): 
	h = {} 
	for ch in str: 
		if ch in h: 
			return ch; 
		else: 
			h[ch] = 0 
		return None

Here's another example:

Requirement:
'''python
def monotonic (str)

1: 	for each element in l do 
2: 		if the element is greater than its previous element then 
3: 			l increases 
4: 		if the element is less than its previous element then 
5: 			l decreases 
6: 	if both increase and decrease then 
7: 		return False 
8: 	else

			increasing = True 
		if l[i] < l[i-1]: 
			decreasing = True 
	if increasing and decreasing:

	else: return True

Now, I want you to analyze the following problem:

Requirement:
'''python
def max_of_three(num1,num2,num3)
	"""

       lnum = num2
    else:
       lnum = num3
    return lnum
'''

You'll need to summarize the solution code as a procedure, similar to the examples above. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops.
The necessary details should be written in natural languages. And mind your indentation accroading to code logic.
Do not touch specific implementation details, just like in examples.
Please put [BEGIN] before your procedure and [END] after it. You don't need to put "Prucedure" at the beginning.

You'll need to summarize the solution code as a procedure, similar to the examples above. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops.
The necessary details should be written in natural languages. And mind your indentation accroading to code logic.
Do not touch specific implementation details, just like in examples.
Please put [BEGIN] before your procedure and [END] after it. You don't need to put "Prucedure" at the beginning.

		if l[i] > l[i-1]: 
			increasing = True 
		if l[i] < l[i-1]: 
			decreasing = True 
	if increasing and decreasing: 
		return False 
	else: return True

Now, I want you to analyze the following problem:

Requirement:
'''python
def sort_dict_item(test_dict)
	"""
	Write a function to sort dictionary items by tuple product of keys for the given dictionary with tuple keys.
	"""
	Pass
'''

Here's the solution code for this problem:
'''python
def sort_dict_item(test_dict):
  res = {key: test_dict[key] for key in sorted(test_dict.keys(), key = lambda ele: ele[1] * ele[0])}
  return  (res) 

'''

You'll need to summarize the solution code as a procedure, similar to the examples above. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops.
The necessary details should be written in natural languages. And mind your indentation accroading to code logic.
Do not touch specific implementation details, just like in examples.
Please put [BEGIN] before your procedure and [END] after it. You don't need to put "Prucedure" at the beginning.

==================================================
You are an expert Python programmer. I need you to analyze a programming problem and provide a step-by-step solution procedure.

Here's an example of what I'm looking for:

Requirement:
'''python
def first_Repeated_Char(str): 
	""" 
	Write a python function to find the first repeated character in a given string. 
	""" 
	Pass
'''


Procudure:
Input: str: a string 
Output: ch: a repeated character in str 
1: for each character ch in str: 
2: 		if ch appears more than once in str: 
3: 		return ch 
4: return None 


Solution:
def first_Repeated_Char(str): 
	h = {} 
	for ch in str: 
		if ch in h: 
			return ch; 
		else: 
			h[ch] = 0 
		return None

Here's another example:

Requirement:
'''python
def monotonic (str)
	"""
	Complete this method, return True is list elements are monotonically increasing or decreasing.
	"""
	Pass
'''


Procedure:
Input: l: list 
Output: True or False 
1: 	for each element in l do 
2: 		if the element is greater than its previous element then 
3: 			l increases 
4: 		if the element is less than its previous element then 
5: 			l decreases 
6: 	if both increase and decrease then 
7: 		return False 
8: 	else 
9: 		return True 


Solution:
def monotonic(l: list): 
	increasing = False 
	decreasing = False 
	for i in range(1, len(l)): 
		if l[i] > l[i-1]: 
			increasing = True 
		if l[i] < l[i-1]: 
			decreasing = True 
	if increasing and decreasing: 
		return False 
	else: return True

Now, I want you to analyze the following problem:

Requirement:
'''python

	"""
	Write a python function to find the minimum number of swaps required to convert one binary string to another.
	"""
	Pass
'''

Here's the solution code for this problem:
'''python
def min_Swaps(str1,str2) : 
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(str1)) : 
        if str1[i] != str2[i] : 
            count += 1
    if count % 2 == 0 : 
        return (count // 2) 
    else : 
        return ("Not Possible")
