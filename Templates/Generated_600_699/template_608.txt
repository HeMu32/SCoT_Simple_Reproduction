Input: n: an integer representing the nth Bell number to find
Output: nth Bell number

1: Initialize a 2D list `bell` of size (n+1) x (n+1) with all elements set to 0
2: Set `bell[0][0]` to 1
3: for i from 1 to n (inclusive):
4:     Set `bell[i][0]` to `bell[i-1][i-1]`
5:     for j from 1 to i (inclusive):
6:         Set `bell[i][j]` to `bell[i-1][j-1] + bell[i][j-1]`
7: return `bell[n][0]`
