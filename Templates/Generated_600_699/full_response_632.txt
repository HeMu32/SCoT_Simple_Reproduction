Input: num_list: a list of integers  
Output: x: a list with all zeroes moved to the end  

1: Initialize a list `a` with zeroes, the length of which is equal to the count of zeroes in `num_list`  
2: Initialize a list `x` with all non-zero elements from `num_list`  
3: Extend list `x` with list `a` to move all zeroes to the end  
4: Return the modified list `x`
