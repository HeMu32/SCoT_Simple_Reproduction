Input: ele: a coordinate tuple, sub: a list (default is empty)
Output: a list of all adjacent coordinates of the given coordinate tuple

1: if the input tuple ele is empty:
2:     yield the current sub list
3: else:
4:     for each j in the range from the first element of ele minus 1 to the first element of ele plus 1:
5:         recursively call adjac with the rest of the elements in ele and the current sub list appended with j
6:         yield each result from the recursive call

7: Define a function get_coordinates that takes a test_tup as input
8:     call the adjac function with test_tup and convert the result to a list
9:     return the list of adjacent coordinates
