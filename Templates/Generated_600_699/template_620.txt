Input: a: list of integers, n: length of the list
Output: The size of the largest subset where each pair is divisible

1: Initialize a list dp of size n with all elements set to 0.
2: Set the last element of dp to 1, as the largest subset for a single element is the element itself.
3: Loop i from n-2 to 0 (decrementing by 1):
4:     Initialize mxm to 0.
5:     Loop j from i+1 to n-1 (incrementing by 1):
6:         If a[j] is divisible by a[i] or a[i] is divisible by a[j]:
7:             Update mxm to the maximum of mxm and dp[j].
8:     Set dp[i] to 1 + mxm.
9: Return the maximum value in dp.
