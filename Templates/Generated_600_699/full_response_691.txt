[BEGIN]
Input: test_list: a list of tuples
Output: res: a dictionary where keys are the second elements of the tuples and values are lists of the first elements grouped by the second elements

1: Initialize an empty dictionary res
2: Sort test_list based on the second element of each tuple
3: Loop through each group of tuples grouped by their second element:
4:     For each group, set the key in res to the second element of the tuple
5:     For each tuple in the group, append the first element to the list in res corresponding to the key
6: Return res
