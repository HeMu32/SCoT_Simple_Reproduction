Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two tuples of the same length
Output: res: a boolean value indicating if each element of the second tuple is greater than its corresponding element in the first tuple
1: Initialize a variable res to store the result of the comparison
2: Use a loop to iterate over the elements of both tuples simultaneously
3:     for each pair of elements (x from test_tup1 and y from test_tup2):
4:         check if x is less than y
5:     if all comparisons are true:
6:         set res to True
7:     else:
8:         set res to False
9: return res
