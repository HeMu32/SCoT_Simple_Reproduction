Input: string: a string containing spaces
Output: A new string with all spaces replaced by '%20'

1: Remove leading and trailing spaces from the string
2: Calculate the length of the string
3: Count the number of spaces in the string
4: Calculate the new length of the string after replacing spaces with '%20'
5: If the new length exceeds the maximum allowed length (1000), return -1
6: Convert the string into a list of characters
7: Extend the list to accommodate the new length
8: Initialize an index to the last position of the new length
9: Loop through the original string in reverse order
10:     If the current character is a space:
11:         Replace the current position and the two positions before it with '0', '2', and '%', respectively
12:         Move the index back by 3 positions
13:     Else:
14:         Copy the current character to the new position
15:         Move the index back by 1 position
16: Convert the list back to a string
17: Return the new string
