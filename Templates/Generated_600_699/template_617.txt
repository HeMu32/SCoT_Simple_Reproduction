Input: a, b, d: integers representing the lengths of two jumps and the target distance d to reach from the origin in a 2D plane.
Output: The minimum number of jumps required to reach the point (d, 0).

1: Set temp to a.
2: Set a to the minimum of a and b.
3: Set b to the maximum of temp and b.
4: If d is greater than or equal to b:
5:     Return the result of (d + b - 1) divided by b.
6: If d is equal to 0:
7:     Return 0.
8: If d is equal to a:
9:     Return 1.
10: Otherwise:
11:     Return 2.
