Input: a, b: two lists of integers, n: an integer representing the length of the lists
Output: sum: an integer representing the minimum sum of absolute differences of the two arrays
1: Sort the list a
2: Sort the list b
3: Initialize sum to 0
4: for each index i from 0 to n-1 do
5:     Calculate the absolute difference between a[i] and b[i]
6:     Add the absolute difference to sum
7: return sum
