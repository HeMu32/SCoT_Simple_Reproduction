Input: n: an integer 
Output: ludics: a list of ludic numbers up to n 

1: Initialize an empty list `ludics`
2: For each integer `i` from 1 to n inclusive:
3:     Add `i` to `ludics`
4: Set `index` to 1
5: While `index` is not equal to the length of `ludics`:
6:     Set `first_ludic` to the element at `index` in `ludics`
7:     Set `remove_index` to `index + first_ludic`
8:     While `remove_index` is less than the length of `ludics`:
9:         Remove the element at `remove_index` from `ludics`
10:        Increment `remove_index` by `first_ludic - 1`
11:    Increment `index` by 1
12: Return `ludics`
