[BEGIN]
Input: str1, str2: two binary strings of equal length  
Output: minimum number of swaps required to convert str1 to str2, or "Not Possible" if it cannot be done  

1: Initialize count to 0  
2: For each index i in the range of the length of str1:  
3:     If the character at index i in str1 is not equal to the character at index i in str2:  
4:         Increment count by 1  
5: If count is even:  
6:     Return count divided by 2  
7: Else:  
8:     Return "Not Possible"
