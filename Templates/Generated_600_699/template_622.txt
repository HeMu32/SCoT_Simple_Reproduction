Input: arr1, arr2: two sorted arrays of the same size n
Output: median: the median of the combined arrays

1: Initialize i and j to 0 (pointers for arr1 and arr2)
2: Initialize m1 and m2 to -1 (to store the last two elements seen)
3: Initialize count to 0 (to count the number of elements processed)
4: Loop while count is less than n + 1:
5:     Increment count by 1
6:     If i is equal to n (all elements of arr1 are processed):
7:         Set m1 to m2
8:         Set m2 to the first element of arr2
9:         Break the loop
10:    Else if j is equal to n (all elements of arr2 are processed):
11:        Set m1 to m2
12:        Set m2 to the first element of arr1
13:        Break the loop
14:    Else if the current element in arr1 is less than or equal to the current element in arr2:
15:        Set m1 to m2
16:        Set m2 to the current element in arr1
17:        Increment i by 1
18:    Else:
19:        Set m1 to m2
20:        Set m2 to the current element in arr2
21:        Increment j by 1
22: Return the average of m1 and m2 as the median
