Input: n: an integer
Output: an integer with the rightmost unset bit set

1: if n is 0:
2:     return 1
3: if n and (n + 1) is 0:
4:     return n
5: calculate the position of the rightmost set bit in the bitwise NOT of n
6:     set pos to the result of get_Pos_Of_Right_most_Set_Bit(~n)
7: set the bit at position pos - 1 in n
8:     return (1 << (pos - 1)) | n
