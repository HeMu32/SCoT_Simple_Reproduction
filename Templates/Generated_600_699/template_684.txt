Input: str: a string, x: a character, n: the number of times the string is repeated
Output: count: the number of occurrences of x in the repeated string

1: Initialize count to 0
2: Loop through each character in str:
3:     If the current character equals x:
4:         Increment count by 1
5: Calculate the number of full repetitions of str in n as repititions = n // len(str)
6: Multiply count by repititions to get the total count for full repetitions
7: Calculate the remaining length of str to be considered as l = n % len(str)
8: Loop through the first l characters of str:
9:     If the current character equals x:
10:        Increment count by 1
11: Return count
