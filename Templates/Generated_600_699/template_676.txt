Input: text1: a string  
Output: text1: a string with only alphanumeric characters  

1: Import the `re` module to use regular expressions.  
2: Define a function `remove_extra_char` that takes a single parameter `text1`.  
3:   Compile a regular expression pattern that matches any character that is not alphanumeric (`[\W_]+`).  
4:   Use the `sub` method of the compiled pattern to replace all occurrences of non-alphanumeric characters in `text1` with an empty string.  
5:   Return the modified string.
