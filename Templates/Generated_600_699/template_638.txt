Input: v: wind speed in km/h, t: temperature in Celsius
Output: wind chill index as an integer
1: Calculate the wind chill index using the formula:
2:     windchill = 13.12 + 0.6215 * t - 11.37 * v^0.16 + 0.3965 * t * v^0.16
3: Round the calculated wind chill index to the nearest integer
4: Return the rounded wind chill index
