[BEGIN]
Input: nums: a tuple of tuples containing numbers  
Output: result: a list of average values of the numbers in each position across all tuples  

1: Initialize an empty list named result  
2: Unpack the tuples in nums using zip(*nums) to align elements at the same index from each tuple  
3: For each aligned set of elements x in the unpacked tuples:  
4:     Calculate the average of the elements in x by summing them and dividing by the length of x  
5:     Append the calculated average to the result list  
6: Return the result list
