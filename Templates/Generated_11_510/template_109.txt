Input: s: a binary string, n: an integer representing the length of the string
Output: count: the number of rotations of the binary string that result in an odd value

1: Initialize count to 0
2: Loop through each character in the string s from index 0 to n-1
3:     If the current character is '1':
4:         Increment count by 1
5: Return count
