[BEGIN]
Input: n: an integer representing half the length of the binary sequences
Output: res: the count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits

1: Initialize nCr to 1
2: Initialize res to 1
3: for r from 1 to n (inclusive):
4:     Update nCr to (nCr * (n + 1 - r)) / r
5:     Add (nCr * nCr) to res
6: return res
