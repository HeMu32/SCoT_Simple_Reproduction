[BEGIN]
Input: n: an integer
Output: res: the sum of even factors of n

1: If n is odd, return 0
2: Initialize res to 1
3: For i from 2 to the square root of n (inclusive):
4:     Initialize count to 0
5:     Initialize curr_sum to 1
6:     Initialize curr_term to 1
7:     While n is divisible by i:
8:         Increment count by 1
9:         Divide n by i (integer division)
10:        If i is 2 and count is 1:
11:            Set curr_sum to 0
12:        Multiply curr_term by i
13:        Add curr_term to curr_sum
14:     Multiply res by curr_sum
15: If n is greater than or equal to 2:
16:    Multiply res by (1 + n)
17: Return res
