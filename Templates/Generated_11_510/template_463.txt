Input: arr: a list of integers
Output: max_product: the maximum product of a subarray in arr

1: Initialize n as the length of arr
2: Initialize max_ending_here and min_ending_here to 1
3: Initialize max_so_far to 0
4: Initialize flag to 0
5: Loop through each element in arr from index 0 to n-1
6:     If the current element is greater than 0:
7:         Set max_ending_here to max_ending_here multiplied by the current element
8:         Set min_ending_here to the minimum of min_ending_here multiplied by the current element and 1
9:         Set flag to 1
10:    Else if the current element is 0:
11:        Set max_ending_here and min_ending_here to 1
12:    Else (the current element is less than 0):
13:        Store the value of max_ending_here in a temporary variable temp
14:        Set max_ending_here to the maximum of min_ending_here multiplied by the current element and 1
15:        Set min_ending_here to temp multiplied by the current element
16:    If max_so_far is less than max_ending_here:
17:        Set max_so_far to max_ending_here
18: If flag is 0 and max_so_far is 0:
19:    Return 0
20: Return max_so_far
