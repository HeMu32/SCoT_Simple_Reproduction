Input: arr: list of integers, N: length of arr, P: a prime number
Output: count: number of elements in arr whose modular inverse under P is equal to itself

1: Initialize a variable `current_element` to 0 to keep track of the count of elements meeting the condition.
2: Loop through each element in `arr` using an index `i` from 0 to N-1:
3:     Calculate the square of the current element `arr[i]`.
4:     Check if the square of `arr[i]` modulo P equals 1:
5:         If true, increment `current_element` by 1.
6: After the loop, return the value of `current_element`.
