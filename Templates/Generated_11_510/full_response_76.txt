[BEGIN]
Input: m, n: dimensions of the rectangle (m and n are integers)
Output: count: number of squares in the rectangle

1: if n is less than m:
2:     swap the values of m and n
3: calculate the total number of squares using the formula:
4:     count = (m * (m + 1) * (2 * m + 1) / 6) + ((n - m) * m * (m + 1) / 2)
5: return count
