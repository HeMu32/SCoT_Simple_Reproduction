Input: n: an integer (expected to be an odd number)
Output: average: the average of all odd numbers up to and including n, or "Invalid Input" if n is not an odd number

1: if n is even:
2:     return "Invalid Input"
3: initialize sm to 0 (to store the sum of odd numbers)
4: initialize count to 0 (to count the number of odd numbers)
5: while n is greater than or equal to 1:
6:     increment count by 1
7:     add n to sm
8:     decrement n by 2
9: return the integer division of sm by count
