Input: n: integer, the number of elements in the array; arr: list of integers
Output: freq: integer, the frequency of the largest value in the array

1: Initialize mn to the first element of arr
2: Initialize freq to 1
3: for each element in arr starting from the second element:
4:     if the current element is greater than mn:
5:         set mn to the current element
6:         reset freq to 1
7:     else if the current element is equal to mn:
8:         increment freq by 1
9: return freq
