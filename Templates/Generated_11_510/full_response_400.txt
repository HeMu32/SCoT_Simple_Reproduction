[BEGIN]
Input: test_list: a list of tuples  
Output: res: the number of unique tuples in the list, considering order of elements in tuples as irrelevant  

1: Initialize an empty list to store sorted tuples  
2: For each tuple sub in test_list:  
3:     Sort the elements of sub to make the order irrelevant  
4:     Convert the sorted sub to a tuple and add it to the list from step 1  
5: Convert the list of sorted tuples to a set to remove duplicates  
6: Convert the set back to a list  
7: Calculate the length of the list from step 6 to get the number of unique tuples  
8: Return the length as res
