[BEGIN]
Input: num: an integer number
Output: True or False

1: Initialize rev_num to 0
2: While num is greater than 0:
3:     Set rev_num to (rev_num * 10 + num % 10)
4:     Set num to num // 10
5: Return rev_num

6: Define a function check(n):
7:     Call the rev function with n as the argument to get rev_num
8:     If 2 * rev_num is equal to n + 1:
9:         Return True
10:    Else:
11:        Return False
