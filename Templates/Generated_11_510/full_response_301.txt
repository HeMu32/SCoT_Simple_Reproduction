Input: d: a dictionary 
Output: depth: an integer representing the depth of the dictionary 
1: if d is a dictionary:
2:     if d is not empty:
3:         for each value in d:
4:             recursively calculate the depth of the value
5:         find the maximum depth among all values
6:         return 1 plus the maximum depth
7:     else:
8:         return 1 (since an empty dictionary has a depth of 1)
9: else:
10:    return 0 (since d is not a dictionary, it has no depth)
