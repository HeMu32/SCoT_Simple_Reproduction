Input: n: an integer
Output: max_sum: the maximum sum obtained by dividing the number into three parts and summing them up

1: Initialize an array dp of size n+1 with all elements set to 0
2: Set dp[0] to 0 and dp[1] to 1
3: for i from 2 to n do
4:     Calculate the sum of dp[i/2], dp[i/3], and dp[i/4]
5:     Set dp[i] to the maximum of the calculated sum and i
6: return dp[n]
