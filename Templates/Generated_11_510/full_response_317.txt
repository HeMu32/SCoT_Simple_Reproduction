[BEGIN]
Input: alist: a list of elements
Output: encoded_list: a list with modified run-length encoding

1: Define a helper function `ctr_ele` that takes a list `el` as input:
   2:     If the length of `el` is greater than 1:
   3:         Return a list containing the length of `el` and the first element of `el`
   4:     Else:
   5:         Return the first element of `el`
6: Use the `groupby` function from the `itertools` module to group consecutive identical elements in `alist`
7: For each group of consecutive identical elements in `alist`:
   8:     Convert the group to a list and pass it to the `ctr_ele` function
   9:     Append the result of `ctr_ele` to the `encoded_list`
10: Return `encoded_list`
