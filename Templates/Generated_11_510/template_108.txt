Input: num1, num2, num3: lists of numbers (assumed to be sorted)
Output: merged_list: a single sorted list containing all elements from num1, num2, and num3

1: Sort num1, num2, and num3 (though they are assumed to be already sorted)
2: Initialize a heap queue (priority queue) to merge the sorted lists
3: Use the heap queue to merge num1, num2, and num3 into a single sorted iterator
4: Convert the merged iterator into a list
5: Return the merged list
