Input: A: a sorted array, x: a number to find
Output: index: the index of the last occurrence of x in A, or -1 if x is not found
1: Initialize left to 0 and right to the last index of A
2: Initialize result to -1
3: While left is less than or equal to right:
4:     Calculate mid as the floor of (left + right) / 2
5:     If x is equal to A[mid]:
6:         Set result to mid
7:         Set left to mid + 1
8:     Else if x is less than A[mid]:
9:         Set right to mid - 1
10:    Else:
11:        Set left to mid + 1
12: Return result
