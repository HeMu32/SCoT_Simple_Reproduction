[BEGIN]
Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two tuples of numbers
Output: res: a tuple containing the results of raising each element of test_tup1 to the power of the corresponding element in test_tup2
1: Initialize an empty list to store the results
2: Loop through the elements of test_tup1 and test_tup2 simultaneously:
3:     For each pair of elements (ele1 from test_tup1 and ele2 from test_tup2):
4:         Compute ele1 raised to the power of ele2
5:         Append the result to the results list
6: Convert the results list to a tuple
7: Return the tuple
