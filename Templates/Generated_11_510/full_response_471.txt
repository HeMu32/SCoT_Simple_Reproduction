Input: arr: list of integers, lens: length of arr, n: divisor integer  
Output: remainder: the remainder of the product of arr elements divided by n  
1: Initialize mul to 1  
2: for i from 0 to lens - 1:  
3:     Compute arr[i] % n and multiply it with mul  
4:     Take the result modulo n and assign it back to mul  
5: return mul % n
