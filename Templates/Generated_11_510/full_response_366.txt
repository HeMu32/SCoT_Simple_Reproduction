Input: list_nums: a list of integers  
Output: the largest product of the pair of adjacent elements from list_nums  
1: Initialize a variable to store the maximum product  
2: Loop through the list using a pair of adjacent elements (a, b)  
3:     Calculate the product of the current pair (a * b)  
4:     If the product is greater than the current maximum product, update the maximum product  
5: Return the maximum product
