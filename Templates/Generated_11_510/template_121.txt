Input: A: list of integers, n: length of list A, sum: target sum, count: current count of elements in the triplet
Output: True if a triplet with the given sum exists, otherwise False

1: If count is 3 and sum is 0:
2:     return True
3: If count is 3 or n is 0 or sum is less than 0:
4:     return False
5: Recursively check two possibilities:
6:     1. Include the current element in the triplet and reduce the sum by the current element's value and increase the count by 1.
7:     2. Exclude the current element and keep the sum and count unchanged.
8: If either of the recursive calls returns True, return True.
9: Otherwise, return False.
