Input: nums: a list of numbers  
Output: result: a list of differences between consecutive numbers in nums  
1: Initialize an empty list result  
2: Loop through the list nums, except the last element, and the list nums, except the first element, simultaneously:  
3:     For each pair of consecutive elements a and b:  
4:         Calculate the difference b - a  
5:         Append the difference to the result list  
6: Return the result list
