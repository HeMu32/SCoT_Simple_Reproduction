Input: n: an integer 
Output: an integer with all even bits set 

1: Initialize count to 0, res to 0, and temp to n
2: While temp is greater than 0:
3:     If count is odd:
4:         Set the bit at position count in res
5:     Increment count by 1
6:     Right shift temp by 1 bit
7: Return the result of bitwise OR between n and res
