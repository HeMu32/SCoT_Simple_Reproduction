[BEGIN]
Input: list1: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two numeric elements
Output: result_min: the minimum product of the pairs of tuples in list1

1: Initialize an empty list to store the products of the tuples
2: For each tuple (x, y) in list1:
3:     Calculate the product of x and y
4:     Append the absolute value of the product to the list
5: Find the minimum value in the list of products
6: Return the minimum value as result_min
