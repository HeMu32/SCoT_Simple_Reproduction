Input: Input: a list of tuples
Output: a list of tuples where each tuple has the same first element

1: Initialize an empty dictionary `out`
2: For each tuple `elem` in `Input`:
3:     Try:
4:         Extend the list associated with the key `elem[0]` in `out` with the remaining elements of `elem` (i.e., `elem[1:]`)
5:     Except KeyError:
6:         Create a new key in `out` with `elem[0]` and set its value to a list of all elements in `elem`
7: Initialize an empty list `result`
8: For each value in `out.values()`:
9:     Convert the value to a tuple and append it to `result`
10: Return `result`
