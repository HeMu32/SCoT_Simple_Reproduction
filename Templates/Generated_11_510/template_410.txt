Input: listval: a heterogeneous list 
Output: min_val: the minimum integer value in listval 

1: Initialize a variable min_val to store the minimum value found
2: Loop through each element i in listval:
3:     If i is an integer:
4:         Compare i with the current min_val
5:         If i is less than min_val or min_val is not yet set:
6:             Set min_val to i
7: Return min_val
