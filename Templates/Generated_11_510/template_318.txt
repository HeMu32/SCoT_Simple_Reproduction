Input: s: an integer representing the sum of the sides of a cuboid
Output: maxvalue: the maximum volume of a cuboid with the given sum of sides
1: Initialize maxvalue to 0
2: for each value of i from 1 to s - 1:
3:     for each value of j from 1 to s:
4:         Calculate k as s - i - j
5:         Calculate the volume as i * j * k
6:         Update maxvalue to the maximum of maxvalue and the calculated volume
7: return maxvalue
