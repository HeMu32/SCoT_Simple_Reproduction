[BEGIN]
Input: a, b, n: integers
Output: A tuple (x, y) of integers that satisfies the equation ax + by = n, or a message "No solution" if no such x and y exist.

1: Initialize i to 0
2: Loop while i * a is less than or equal to n:
3:     Calculate the remainder of (n - (i * a)) divided by b
4:     If the remainder is 0:
5:         Calculate y as (n - (i * a)) divided by b
6:         Return the tuple (i, y) as the solution
7:     Increment i by 1
8: If the loop completes without finding a solution:
9:     Return "No solution"
