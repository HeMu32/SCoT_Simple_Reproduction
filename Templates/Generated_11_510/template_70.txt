Input: Input: a list of tuples, k: an integer representing the expected length of each tuple
Output: A string indicating whether all tuples have the same length or not

1: Initialize a flag variable to 1
2: Loop through each tuple in the Input list
3:     If the length of the current tuple is not equal to k:
4:         Set the flag to 0
5:         Break the loop
6: Return the flag value
7: If the flag is 1:
8:     Return "All tuples have same length"
9: Else:
10:    Return "All tuples do not have same length"
