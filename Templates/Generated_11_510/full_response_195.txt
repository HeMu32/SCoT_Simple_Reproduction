[BEGIN]
Input: arr: a sorted array, x: the element to find, n: the number of elements in arr
Output: The index of the first occurrence of x in arr, or -1 if x is not found
1: Initialize low to 0 and high to n - 1, and res to -1
2: While low is less than or equal to high:
3:     Calculate mid as (low + high) // 2
4:     If arr[mid] is greater than x:
5:         Set high to mid - 1
6:     Else if arr[mid] is less than x:
7:         Set low to mid + 1
8:     Else:
9:         Set res to mid
10:        Set high to mid - 1
11: Return res
