Input: set: a list of integers, n: the number of elements in the set, sum: the target sum
Output: True if there is a subset of set with a sum equal to the given sum, otherwise False

1: if sum is 0:
2:     return True
3: if n is 0:
4:     return False
5: if the last element of set is greater than sum:
6:     return the result of is_subset_sum with the last element removed and the same sum
7: return the logical OR of:
8:     - is_subset_sum with the last element removed and the same sum
9:     - is_subset_sum with the last element removed and the sum decreased by the last element
