Input: n: an integer
Output: True if n can be represented by the product of two squares, False otherwise
1: for each integer i from 2 to n inclusive:
2:     if i squared is less than n + 1:
3:         for each integer j from 2 to n inclusive:
4:             if the product of i squared and j squared equals n:
5:                 return True
6: return False
