Input: n: an integer representing the number of first natural numbers to consider
Output: difference: an integer representing the difference between the squared sum of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers

1: Initialize sumofsquares to 0
2: Initialize squareofsum to 0
3: for each number num from 1 to n (inclusive):
4:     add num * num to sumofsquares
5:     add num to squareofsum
6: squareofsum = squareofsum squared
7: return the difference between squareofsum and sumofsquares
