Input: n: an integer  
Output: The smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n  
1: Initialize count to 0  
2: If n is a power of 2 (i.e., n is not zero and n & (n - 1) is zero):  
3:     Return n  
4: Else:  
5:     While n is not 0:  
6:         Right shift n by 1 bit  
7:         Increment count by 1  
8:     Return 1 shifted left by count bits
