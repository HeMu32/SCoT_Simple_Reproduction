[BEGIN]
Input: n: a number to be rounded, m: the specific number to which n should be rounded to the nearest multiple
Output: the nearest multiple of m to n

1: Calculate a as the largest multiple of m that is less than or equal to n
2: Calculate b as the next multiple of m after a
3: If the difference between n and a is greater than the difference between b and n:
4:     Return b
5: Else:
6:     Return a
