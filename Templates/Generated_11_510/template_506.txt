Input: n, k: integers representing the parameters for the permutation coefficient calculation
Output: The permutation coefficient P(n, k)

1: Initialize a 2D list P of size (n+1) x (k+1) with all elements set to 0
2: for i from 0 to n inclusive:
3:     for j from 0 to the minimum of i and k inclusive:
4:         if j is 0:
5:             set P[i][j] to 1
6:         else:
7:             set P[i][j] to P[i-1][j] + (j * P[i-1][j-1])
8:         if j is less than k:
9:             set P[i][j+1] to 0
10: return P[n][k]
