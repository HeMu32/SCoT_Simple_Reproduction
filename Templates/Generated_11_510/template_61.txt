Input: s: a string, n: length of the string
Output: count: number of substrings where the sum of digits equals the length of the substring

1: Initialize count and sum to 0
2: Create a dictionary mp with default value 0
3: Set mp[0] to 1
4: For each character at index i in the string s:
5:     Add the numeric value of the character (converted from ASCII) to sum
6:     Add the value of mp[sum - (i + 1)] to count
7:     Increment mp[sum - (i + 1)] by 1
8: Return count
