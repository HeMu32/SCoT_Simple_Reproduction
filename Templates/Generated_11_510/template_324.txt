Input: test_tuple: a tuple of integers  
Output: (sum1, sum2): a tuple containing the sum of elements at odd indices and the sum of elements at even indices, respectively  
1: Initialize sum1 to 0  
2: Initialize sum2 to 0  
3: for each element in test_tuple with index idx and value ele:  
4:     if idx is odd:  
5:         add ele to sum1  
6:     else:  
7:         add ele to sum2  
8: return (sum1, sum2)
