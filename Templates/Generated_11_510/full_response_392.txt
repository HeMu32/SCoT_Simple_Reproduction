Input: n: an integer  
Output: max_sum: the maximum sum possible by using the given equation f(n) = max( (f(n/2) + f(n/3) + f(n/4) + f(n/5)), n)  

1: Initialize a list res with two elements: 0 and 1.  
2: Set i to 2.  
3: While i is less than or equal to n:  
4:     Calculate the value of the expression (res[i/2] + res[i/3] + res[i/4] + res[i/5]) and store it in temp.  
5:     Append the maximum value between i and temp to res.  
6:     Increment i by 1.  
7: Return the nth element of res.
