Input: nestedlist: a list of lists
Output: result: a list of common elements found in all sublists

1: Convert each sublist in nestedlist to a set to remove duplicates and allow set operations
2: Use the map function to apply the set conversion to all sublists
3: Use the set.intersection method to find common elements across all converted sets
4: Convert the result of the intersection back to a list
5: Return the result list
