Input: grid: a 2D list of integers representing a 2 x n grid
Output: max_sum: the maximum sum such that no two chosen numbers are adjacent

1: Initialize `incl` to the maximum value of the first column of the grid.
2: Initialize `excl` to 0.
3: For each column index `i` from 1 to n-1:
4:     Set `excl_new` to the maximum of `excl` and `incl`.
5:     Set `incl` to `excl` plus the maximum value of the current column.
6:     Set `excl` to `excl_new`.
7: Return the maximum of `excl` and `incl`.
