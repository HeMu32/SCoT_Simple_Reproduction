Input: tup: a list of tuples
Output: sorted_tup: a list of tuples sorted by the last element in each tuple
1: lst = length of tup
2: for i from 0 to lst - 1:
3:     for j from 0 to lst - i - 2:
4:         if the last element of tup[j] is greater than the last element of tup[j + 1]:
5:             swap tup[j] and tup[j + 1]
6: return tup
