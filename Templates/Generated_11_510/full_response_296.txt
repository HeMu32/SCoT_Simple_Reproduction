Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of arr
Output: inv_count: the number of inversions in arr

1: Initialize inv_count to 0
2: for i from 0 to n-1 do
3:     for j from i+1 to n-1 do
4:         if arr[i] is greater than arr[j] then
5:             increment inv_count by 1
6: return inv_count
