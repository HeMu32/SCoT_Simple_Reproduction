Input: nums: an array of integers  
Output: ratio: the ratio of positive numbers in nums  
1: Initialize n to the length of nums  
2: Initialize n1 to 0  
3: for each element x in nums do  
4:     if x is greater than 0 then  
5:         increment n1 by 1  
6:     else  
7:         do nothing  
8: Calculate the ratio of positive numbers as n1 divided by n  
9: Return the ratio rounded to 2 decimal places
