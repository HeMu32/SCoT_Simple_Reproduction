Input: a: list of integers, n: length of the list, m: divisor integer  
Output: position: the position of the last removed element from the array

1: for each element in the list a from index 0 to n-1:
2:     update the element to be the integer division of the element by m plus 1 if the remainder of the division by m is not zero
3: initialize result and maxx to -1
4: for each element in the list a from index n-1 to 0:
5:     if the current element is greater than maxx:
6:         update maxx to the current element
7:         update result to the current index
8: return result + 1
