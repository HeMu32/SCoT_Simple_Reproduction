Input: string: a binary string, n: length of the string
Output: max_diff: the maximum difference between the number of 0s and number of 1s in any sub-string of the given binary string

1: Initialize current_sum to 0
2: Initialize max_sum to 0
3: for each character in the string from index 0 to n-1 do
4:     if the character is '0' then
5:         increment current_sum by 1
6:     else
7:         decrement current_sum by 1
8:     if current_sum is less than 0 then
9:         set current_sum to 0
10:    update max_sum to be the maximum of current_sum and max_sum
11: return max_sum if max_sum is greater than 0, otherwise return 0
