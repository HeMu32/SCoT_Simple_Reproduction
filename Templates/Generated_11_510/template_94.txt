Output: res: the first element of the tuple with the minimum second element.

1: Use the `min` function with a key that extracts the second element of each tuple.
2:     The `itemgetter(1)` function is used as the key to extract the second element.
3: The `min` function returns the tuple with the smallest second element.
4: Extract the first element of this tuple.
5: Return this first element as the result.
