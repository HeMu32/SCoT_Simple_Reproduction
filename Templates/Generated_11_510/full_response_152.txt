[BEGIN]
Input: a, b: two sorted lists
Output: c: a merged and sorted list of a and b

1: Initialize an empty list c
2: While a is not empty and b is not empty:
3:     If the first element of a is less than the first element of b:
4:         Append the first element of a to c
5:         Remove the first element from a
6:     Else:
7:         Append the first element of b to c
8:         Remove the first element from b
9: If a is empty:
10:    Append all remaining elements of b to c
11: Else:
12:    Append all remaining elements of a to c
13: Return c

Input: x: a list to be sorted
Output: x: a sorted list

1: If the length of x is 0 or 1:
2:     Return x
3: Else:
4:     Find the middle index of x
5:     Recursively call merge_sort on the first half of x and store the result in a
6:     Recursively call merge_sort on the second half of x and store the result in b
7:     Return the result of merge(a, b)
