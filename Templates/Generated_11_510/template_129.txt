Input: my_matrix: a 2D list representing a square matrix
Output: True if the matrix is a magic square, False otherwise

1: iSize = the length of the first row of my_matrix
2: sum_list = an empty list to store the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals
3: for each row in my_matrix:
4:     add the sum of the row to sum_list
5: for each column index in the range of iSize:
6:     add the sum of the column to sum_list
7: result1 = 0
8: for each index i in the range of iSize:
9:     add the element at position (i, i) to result1
10: add result1 to sum_list
11: result2 = 0
12: for each index i in the range of iSize-1 to 0 (decreasing):
13:     add the element at position (i, i) to result2
14: add result2 to sum_list
15: if the length of the set of sum_list is greater than 1:
16:     return False
17: return True
