Input: l1: list, l2: list of lists  
Output: result: list of lists containing elements from l2 that are also in l1  

1: Initialize an empty list `result` to store the final output.
2: For each sublist `lst` in `l2`:
3:     Initialize an empty list `inner_result` to store the matching elements.
4:     For each element `n` in `lst`:
5:         If `n` is in `l1`:
6:             Append `n` to `inner_result`.
7:     Append `inner_result` to `result`.
8: Return `result`.
