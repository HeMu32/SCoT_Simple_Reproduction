Input: limit: an integer 
Output: sum of all amicable numbers from 1 to limit 
1: if limit is not an integer: 
2:     return "Input is not an integer!" 
3: if limit is less than 1: 
4:     return "Input must be bigger than 0!" 
5: initialize an empty set amicables 
6: for num from 2 to limit inclusive: 
7:     if num is in amicables: 
8:         continue 
9:     calculate sum_fact as the sum of all factors of num, excluding num itself 
10:    calculate sum_fact2 as the sum of all factors of sum_fact, excluding sum_fact itself 
11:    if num equals sum_fact2 and num is not equal to sum_fact: 
12:        add num to amicables 
13:        add sum_fact to amicables 
14: return the sum of all elements in amicables
