Input: n: an integer representing the position in the Newman-Conway sequence
Output: the n-th number in the Newman-Conway sequence

1: if n is 1 or 2:
2:     return 1
3: else:
4:     compute the (n-1)-th number in the sequence
5:     compute the n-th number in the sequence minus the (n-1)-th number in the sequence
6:     return the sum of the (n-1)-th number in the sequence and the (n - (n-1)-th number in the sequence)
