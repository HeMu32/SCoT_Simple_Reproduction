[BEGIN]
Input: x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3: coordinates of three points
Output: 'Yes' if the points form a valid triangle, 'No' otherwise

1: Calculate the area of the triangle formed by the points using the formula:
   a = (x1*(y2-y3) + x2*(y3-y1) + x3*(y1-y2))
2: If a is equal to 0:
3:     Return 'No' (The points are collinear and do not form a triangle)
4: Else:
5:     Return 'Yes' (The points form a valid triangle)
