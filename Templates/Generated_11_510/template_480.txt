Input: str1: a string  
Output: ch: the character with the highest frequency in str1  
1: Initialize an array `ctr` of size 256 to zero (to count occurrences of each ASCII character)  
2: Initialize `max` to -1 and `ch` to an empty string  
3: For each character `i` in `str1`:  
4:     Increment `ctr[ord(i)]` by 1  
5: For each character `i` in `str1`:  
6:     If `max` is less than `ctr[ord(i)]`:  
7:         Set `max` to `ctr[ord(i)]`  
8:         Set `ch` to `i`  
9: Return `ch`
