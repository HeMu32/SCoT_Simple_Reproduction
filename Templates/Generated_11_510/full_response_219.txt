Input: test_tup: a tuple, K: an integer
Output: res: a tuple containing the minimum and maximum K elements from test_tup

1: Convert the tuple test_tup to a list to allow modifications
2: Sort the list in ascending order and store it in temp
3: Initialize an empty list res to store the result
4: Loop through each element in temp with index idx and value val
5:     If idx is less than K or idx is greater than or equal to the length of temp minus K
6:         Append val to res
7: Convert res back to a tuple
8: Return res
