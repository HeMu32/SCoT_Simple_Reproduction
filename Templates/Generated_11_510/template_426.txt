Input: nums: a list of numbers  
Output: odd_nums: a list of odd numbers from nums  
1: Initialize odd_nums as an empty list  
2: Use the filter function with a lambda function to iterate over each number x in nums  
3:     if x modulo 2 is not equal to 0 (x is odd):  
4:         Add x to the odd_nums list  
5: Convert the filter object to a list and assign it to odd_nums  
6: Return odd_nums
