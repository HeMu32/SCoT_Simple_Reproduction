[BEGIN]
Input: num1, num2: integers
Output: True or False

1: Define a function divSum that takes an integer n as input
2:     Initialize sum to 1
3:     Initialize i to 2
4:     While i * i is less than or equal to n:
5:         If n is divisible by i:
6:             Add i and n divided by i (integer division) to sum
7:         Increment i by 1
8:     Return sum

9: Define a function areEquivalent that takes two integers num1 and num2 as input
10:    Calculate the sum of divisors for num1 using divSum
11:    Calculate the sum of divisors for num2 using divSum
12:    If the sum of divisors for num1 is equal to the sum of divisors for num2:
13:        Return True
14:    Else:
15:        Return False
