Input: l: list of integers  
Output: gcd: greatest common divisor of the elements in l  
1: if the list l has less than two elements:  
2:     return None (not enough elements to find a GCD)  
3: num1 = l[0]  
4: num2 = l[1]  
5: gcd = find_gcd(num1, num2)  
6: for each element num in l starting from the third element:  
7:     gcd = find_gcd(gcd, num)  
8: return gcd
