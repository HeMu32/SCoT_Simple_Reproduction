[BEGIN]
Input: str: a string 
Output: A substring representing the first maximum length even word or "-1" if no even word exists.

1: Initialize n as the length of str, i as 0, currlen as 0, maxlen as 0, and st as -1.
2: While i is less than n:
3:     If the current character (str[i]) is a space:
4:         If currlen is even:
5:             If currlen is greater than maxlen:
6:                 Set maxlen to currlen and st to i - currlen.
7:         Set currlen to 0.
8:     Else:
9:         Increment currlen by 1.
10:    Increment i by 1.
11: After the loop, if currlen is even:
12:    If currlen is greater than maxlen:
13:        Set maxlen to currlen and st to i - currlen.
14: If st is still -1:
15:    Return "-1".
16: Else:
17:    Return the substring from st to st + maxlen.
