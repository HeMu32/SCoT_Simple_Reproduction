Input: nums: a list of integers  
Output: sorted_nums: a sorted list of integers  

1: Set arr_len to the length of nums  
2: While arr_len is greater than 1:  
3:     Find the index mi of the maximum element in the sublist nums[0:arr_len]  
4:     Flip the sublist nums[0:mi+1] to move the maximum element to the front  
5:     Flip the entire sublist nums[0:arr_len] to move the maximum element to its correct position at the end  
6:     Decrease arr_len by 1  
7: Return nums
