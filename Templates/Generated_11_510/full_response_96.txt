Input: n: an integer 
Output: x: the number of divisors of n 
1: Initialize an empty list to store divisors 
2: Loop through each integer i from 1 to n (inclusive): 
3:     If n is divisible by i (i.e., n % i == 0): 
4:         Add i to the list of divisors 
5: After the loop, calculate the length of the list of divisors 
6: Return the length of the list of divisors
