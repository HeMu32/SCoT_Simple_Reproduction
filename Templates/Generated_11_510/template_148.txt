Input: N: an integer 
Output: sum: the maximum sum of digits of two parts of N 

1: Define a function sum_digits_single(x) to calculate the sum of digits of a number x:
   1.1: Initialize ans to 0
   1.2: While x is not 0:
        1.2.1: Add the last digit of x to ans
        1.2.2: Remove the last digit from x
   1.3: Return ans

2: Define a function closest(x) to find the largest number less than or equal to x with all digits being 9:
   2.1: Initialize ans to 0
   2.2: While (ans * 10 + 9) is less than or equal to x:
        2.2.1: Set ans to (ans * 10 + 9)
   2.3: Return ans

3: Define a function sum_digits_twoparts(N) to divide N into two parts such that the sum of digits is maximized:
   3.1: Call closest(N) to get the largest number A with all digits being 9 and less than or equal to N
   3.2: Calculate the sum of digits of A and (N - A) using sum_digits_single
   3.3: Return the sum of the two results from step 3.2
