Input: ar: a sorted array, N: the length of the array
Output: The missing number in the array or -1 if there is no missing number
1: Initialize l to 0
2: Initialize r to N - 1
3: While l is less than or equal to r:
4:     Calculate mid as (l + r) / 2 and convert it to an integer
5:     If ar[mid] is not equal to mid + 1 and ar[mid - 1] is equal to mid:
6:         Return mid + 1
7:     Else if ar[mid] is not equal to mid + 1:
8:         Set r to mid - 1
9:     Else:
10:        Set l to mid + 1
11: Return -1
