[BEGIN]
Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the number of elements in arr, p: the number of times to perform the operation
Output: "EVEN" or "ODD" based on the parity of the last element after p operations

1: Initialize _sum to 0
2: for each element in arr from 0 to n-1 do
3:     add the element to _sum
4: if p equals 1 then
5:     if _sum is even then
6:         return "ODD"
7:     else
8:         return "EVEN"
9: else
10:    return "EVEN"
