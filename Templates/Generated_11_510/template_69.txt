Input: l: list, s: sublist
Output: sub_set: boolean indicating if s is a sublist of l
1: Initialize sub_set to False
2: If s is an empty list:
3:     Set sub_set to True
4: Else if s is equal to l:
5:     Set sub_set to True
6: Else if the length of s is greater than the length of l:
7:     Set sub_set to False
8: Else:
9:     For each index i in the range of the length of l:
10:        If the element at index i in l is equal to the first element in s:
11:           Initialize n to 1
12:           While n is less than the length of s and the element at index i+n in l is equal to the element at index n in s:
13:              Increment n by 1
14:           If n is equal to the length of s:
15:              Set sub_set to True
16:              Break the loop
17: Return sub_set
