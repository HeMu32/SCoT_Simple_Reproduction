Input: n: an integer representing the number of even natural numbers to consider
Output: sum: the sum of the fifth power of the first n even natural numbers
1: Initialize sum to 0
2: for i from 1 to n (inclusive):
3:     Calculate j as 2 * i (to get the ith even number)
4:     Calculate the fifth power of j
5:     Add the fifth power of j to sum
6: return sum
