Input: test_list: a list of tuples
Output: res: a string representation of a list of tuples with each original tuple extended by its frequency

1: Initialize a Counter object with test_list to count the frequency of each tuple
2: Initialize an empty list res
3: For each key and value pair in the items of the Counter object:
4:     Extend the key tuple with the value (frequency) to form a new tuple
5:     Append the new tuple to res
6: Convert res to a string representation
7: Return the string representation of res
