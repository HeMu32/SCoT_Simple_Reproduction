Input: test_list: a list of tuples representing ranges, strt_val: an integer representing the start value, stop_val: an integer representing the stop value
Output: res: a list of tuples representing the missing ranges

1: Initialize an empty list res to store the missing ranges
2: Loop through each tuple sub in test_list
3:     If the first element of sub is greater than strt_val:
4:         Append the tuple (strt_val, sub[0]) to res
5:         Set strt_val to the second element of sub
6: After the loop, if strt_val is less than stop_val:
7:     Append the tuple (strt_val, stop_val) to res
8: Return res
