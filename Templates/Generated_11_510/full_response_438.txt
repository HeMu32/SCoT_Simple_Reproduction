Input: test_list: a list of tuples  
Output: res: a count of bidirectional tuple pairs in test_list  
1: Initialize res to 0  
2: for each index idx in the range from 0 to the length of test_list - 1:  
3:     for each index iidx in the range from idx + 1 to the length of test_list - 1:  
4:         if the first element of the tuple at index iidx is equal to the second element of the tuple at index idx, and the second element of the tuple at index idx is equal to the first element of the tuple at index iidx:  
5:             increment res by 1  
6: return res as a string
