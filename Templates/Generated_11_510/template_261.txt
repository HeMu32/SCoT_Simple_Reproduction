Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two tuples of numbers
Output: res: a tuple containing the result of element-wise division of test_tup1 by test_tup2

1: Initialize an empty tuple res
2: Loop through each pair of elements (ele1, ele2) from test_tup1 and test_tup2 using zip:
3:     Perform integer division (ele1 // ele2) and store the result
4:     Add the result to the tuple res
5: Return the tuple res
