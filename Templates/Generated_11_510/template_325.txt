Input: n: an integer
Output: res: the minimum number of squares whose sum is equal to n
1: if n is less than or equal to 3:
2:     return n
3: initialize res to n
4: for x from 1 to n:
5:     calculate temp as x squared
6:     if temp is greater than n:
7:         break the loop
8:     else:
9:         calculate the result of get_Min_Squares(n - temp) and add 1 to it
10:        update res to the minimum of res and the calculated result
11: return res
