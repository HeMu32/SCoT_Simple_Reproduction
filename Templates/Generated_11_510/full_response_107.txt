Input: L, R: integers representing the range
Output: count: the number of hexadecimal numbers within the range [L, R]

1: Initialize count to 0
2: for each integer i in the range from L to R inclusive:
3:     if i is between 10 and 15 inclusive:
4:         increment count by 1
5:     elif i is greater than 15:
6:         set k to i
7:         while k is not 0:
8:             if the remainder of k divided by 16 is greater than or equal to 10:
9:                 increment count by 1
10:            set k to the integer division of k by 16
11: return count
