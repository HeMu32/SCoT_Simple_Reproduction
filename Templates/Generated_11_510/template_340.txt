Input: lst: a list of numbers
Output: sum: the sum of the three lowest positive numbers in lst
1: Initialize an empty list positive_nums
2: for each number num in lst:
3:     if num is greater than 0:
4:         append num to positive_nums
5: sort positive_nums in ascending order
6: if the length of positive_nums is less than 3:
7:     return None (not enough positive numbers)
8: else:
9:     return the sum of the first three elements in positive_nums
