Input: my_list: a list of elements to be sorted
Output: my_list: the sorted list

1: Initialize gap as the integer division of the length of my_list by 2
2: While gap is greater than 0:
3:     For each index i starting from gap to the length of my_list:
4:         Set current_item to my_list[i]
5:         Set j to i
6:         While j is greater than or equal to gap and the element at index (j - gap) in my_list is greater than current_item:
7:             Set my_list[j] to the element at index (j - gap)
8:             Decrease j by gap
9:         Set my_list[j] to current_item
10:    Integer divide gap by 2
11: Return my_list
