Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list
Output: sum: the sum of even numbers at even positions in the list
1: Initialize sum to 0
2: for each index i in the range from 0 to n, incrementing by 2:
3:     if the element at index i in arr is even:
4:         add the element at index i to sum
5: return sum
