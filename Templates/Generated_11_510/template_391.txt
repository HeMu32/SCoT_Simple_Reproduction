Input: l1, l2, l3: lists
Output: result: a list of nested dictionaries

1: Initialize an empty list called result
2: Use a loop to iterate over the elements of l1, l2, and l3 simultaneously using the zip function
3:     For each tuple (x, y, z) from the zip function:
4:         Create a nested dictionary with x as the key and another dictionary as its value
5:         The inner dictionary has y as the key and z as the value
6:         Append the nested dictionary to the result list
7: Return the result list
