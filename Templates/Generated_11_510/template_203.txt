Input: n1, n2: two integers  
Output: setBits: the Hamming distance between n1 and n2  
1: Compute the bitwise XOR of n1 and n2 and store the result in x  
2: Initialize setBits to 0  
3: While x is greater than 0:  
4:     If the least significant bit of x is 1:  
5:         Increment setBits by 1  
6:     Right shift x by 1 bit  
7: Return setBits
