[BEGIN]
Input: s: a string containing brackets '[' and ']'
Output: swap: the minimum number of swaps required to balance the brackets

1: Initialize count_left to 0 to count the number of '['
2: Initialize count_right to 0 to count the number of ']'
3: Initialize swap to 0 to count the number of swaps needed
4: Initialize imbalance to 0 to track the imbalance of brackets
5: Loop through each character in the string s
6:     If the character is '['
7:         Increment count_left by 1
8:         If imbalance is greater than 0
9:             Increment swap by imbalance
10:            Decrement imbalance by 1
11:    Else if the character is ']'
12:        Increment count_right by 1
13:        Set imbalance to (count_right - count_left)
14: Return swap
