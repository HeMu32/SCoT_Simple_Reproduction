Input: num: an integer number
Output: sum: the minimum sum of factors of num
1: Initialize sum to 0
2: Initialize i to 2
3: While i * i is less than or equal to num:
4:     While num is divisible by i:
5:         Add i to sum
6:         Divide num by i
7:     Increment i by 1
8: Add the remaining num to sum
9: Return sum
