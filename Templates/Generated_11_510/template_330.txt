Input: text: a string  
Output: words: a list of words that are 3 to 5 characters long  
1: import the re module  
2: define a function find_char that takes a string text as an argument

4:   the regex pattern \b\w{3,5}\b is used to match words of the specified length  
5:   \b asserts a word boundary, \w matches any word character, and {3,5} specifies the length of the word  
6:   return the list of matched words
