Input: n: a non-negative integer
Output: ctr: the count of prime numbers less than n

1: Initialize ctr to 0
2: for each number num in the range from 0 to n-1:
3:     if num is less than or equal to 1:
4:         continue to the next iteration
5:     for each i in the range from 2 to num-1:
6:         if num is divisible by i:
7:             break the inner loop
8:     if the inner loop was not broken (num is not divisible by any i):
9:         increment ctr by 1
10: return ctr
