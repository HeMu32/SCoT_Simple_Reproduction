Input: number: an integer  
Output: sum of all divisors of number  
1: Initialize a list `divisors` with the first element 1  
2: for each integer `i` from 2 to `number - 1`:  
3:     if `number` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `number % i == 0`):  
4:         append `i` to the list `divisors`  
5: return the sum of all elements in the list `divisors`
