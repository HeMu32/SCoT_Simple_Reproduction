Input: n: integer, the number of elements in the array; arr: list of integers
Output: freq: integer, the frequency of the smallest value in the array

1: Initialize mn to the first element of arr
2: Initialize freq to 1
3: for each element arr[i] in arr starting from the second element:
4:     if arr[i] is less than mn:
5:         set mn to arr[i]
6:         reset freq to 1
7:     elif arr[i] is equal to mn:
8:         increment freq by 1
9: return freq
