Input: n: an integer  
Output: an integer with the leftmost unset bit set  

1: if n & (n + 1) is 0:  
2:     return n  
3: initialize pos to 0, temp to n, and count to 0  
4: while temp is not 0:  
5:     if the least significant bit of temp is 0:  
6:         set pos to count  
7:     increment count by 1  
8:     right shift temp by 1 bit  
9: return n with the bit at position pos set to 1
