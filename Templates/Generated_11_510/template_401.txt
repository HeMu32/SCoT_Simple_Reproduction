Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two nested tuples of integers
Output: res: a nested tuple with the result of index-wise addition of test_tup1 and test_tup2

1: Initialize an empty tuple res to store the result.
2: Loop through each pair of nested tuples (tup1, tup2) from test_tup1 and test_tup2 using zip.
3:   Initialize an empty tuple inner_res to store the result of the current nested tuple addition.
4:   Loop through each pair of elements (a, b) from tup1 and tup2 using zip.
5:     Add a and b and append the result to inner_res.
6:   Append inner_res to res.
7: Return res.
