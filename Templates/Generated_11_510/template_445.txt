Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two tuples of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numeric elements.
Output: res: a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains the result of element-wise multiplication of the corresponding tuples from test_tup1 and test_tup2.

1: Initialize an empty list to store the result of the multiplication.
2: For each pair of inner tuples (tup1, tup2) from test_tup1 and test_tup2:
3:     Initialize an empty list to store the result of the current pair of inner tuples.
4:     For each pair of elements (a, b) from tup1 and tup2:
5:         Multiply a by b and append the result to the current result list.
6:     Convert the current result list to a tuple and append it to the result list.
7: Convert the result list to a tuple.
8: Return the result tuple.
