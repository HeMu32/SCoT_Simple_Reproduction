[BEGIN]
Input: test_list: a list of tuples
Output: res: a dictionary with the count of occurrences of each unique tuple (considering sorted tuples as identical)

1: Initialize an empty dictionary res to store the result
2: For each element ele in test_list:
3:     Sort the elements of the tuple ele to handle permutations as identical
4:     Convert the sorted list back to a tuple
5:     If the tuple is already a key in res:
6:         Increment the count of the tuple in res
7:     Else:
8:         Add the tuple to res with a count of 1
9: Return res
