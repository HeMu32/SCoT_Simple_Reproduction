Input: A: an array of integers, n: the number of elements in A
Output: The largest palindromic number in A, or -1 if no palindromic number exists

1: Sort the array A in ascending order
2: Loop from the last element to the first element in A (i from n-1 to 0)
3:     If the current element A[i] is a palindrome:
4:         Return A[i]
5: If no palindromic number is found:
6:     Return -1
