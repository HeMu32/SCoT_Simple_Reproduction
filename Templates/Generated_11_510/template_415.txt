Input: arr: a list of integers
Output: x, y: a pair of integers from arr with the highest product

1: arr_len = length of arr
2: if arr_len is less than 2:
3:     return "No pairs exists"
4: x = arr[0]; y = arr[1]
5: for i from 0 to arr_len - 1:
6:     for j from i + 1 to arr_len - 1:
7:         if arr[i] * arr[j] is greater than x * y:
8:             x = arr[i]; y = arr[j]
9: return x, y
