Input: s: a string  
Output: min_length: the minimized length of the string by removing the most frequent character  
1: Initialize maxOcc to 0  
2: Initialize n to the length of s  
3: Initialize an array arr of size 26 with all elements set to 0  
4: For each character ch in s:  
5:     Increment arr[ord(ch) - ord('a')] by 1  
6: For each element in arr:  
7:     If the element is greater than maxOcc:  
8:         Set maxOcc to the element  
9: Return n - maxOcc
