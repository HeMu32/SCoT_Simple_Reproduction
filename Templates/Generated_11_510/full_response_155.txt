[BEGIN]
Input: n: an integer 
Output: an integer with all even bits toggled 
1: Initialize res to 0 and count to 0 
2: Set temp to n 
3: While temp is greater than 0: 
4:     If count is odd: 
5:         Toggle the bit at position count in res 
6:     Increment count by 1 
7:     Right shift temp by 1 bit 
8: Return the result of XOR between n and res
