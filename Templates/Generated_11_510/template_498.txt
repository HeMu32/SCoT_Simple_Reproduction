Input: x, y: two positive integers 
Output: gcd: the greatest common divisor of x and y 
1: Initialize gcd to 1 
2: If x is divisible by y then 
3:     Return y 
4: For k from y/2 down to 1 do 
5:     If x is divisible by k and y is divisible by k then 
6:         Set gcd to k 
7:         Break the loop 
8: Return gcd
