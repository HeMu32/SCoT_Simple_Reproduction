[BEGIN]
Input: N: an integer representing the side length of the larger equilateral triangle, K: an integer representing the side length of the smaller equilateral triangles to be formed.
Output: The maximum number of equilateral triangles of side length K that can be formed within the larger triangle of side length N.

1: If N is less than K:
2:     Return -1 (it's not possible to form any triangle of side K within a triangle of side N)
3: Else:
4:     Initialize Tri_up to 0 (to store the count of triangles pointing upwards)
5:     Calculate Tri_up using the formula ((N - K + 1) * (N - K + 2)) // 2
6:     Initialize Tri_down to 0 (to store the count of triangles pointing downwards)
7:     Calculate Tri_down using the formula ((N - 2 * K + 1) * (N - 2 * K + 2)) // 2
8:     Return the sum of Tri_up and Tri_down
