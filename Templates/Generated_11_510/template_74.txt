Input: colors: a list of colors, patterns: a list of patterns
Output: True if the colors follow the sequence given in the patterns array, otherwise False

1: if the length of colors is not equal to the length of patterns:
2:     return False
3: initialize sdict as an empty dictionary
4: initialize pset as an empty set
5: initialize sset as an empty set
6: for each index i in the range of the length of patterns:
7:     add patterns[i] to pset
8:     add colors[i] to sset
9:     if patterns[i] is not in sdict:
10:         add patterns[i] as a key in sdict with an empty list as its value
11:     append colors[i] to the list of sdict[patterns[i]]
12: if the length of pset is not equal to the length of sset:
13:     return False
14: for each list of values in sdict:
15:     for each index i in the range of the length of values - 1:
16:         if values[i] is not equal to values[i+1]:
17:             return False
18: return True
