[BEGIN]
Input: test_list: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers
Output: res: the maximum difference between the pairs in the tuples

1: Initialize an empty list temp
2: For each tuple (a, b) in test_list:
3:     Calculate the absolute difference between a and b
4:     Append the calculated difference to temp
5: Find the maximum value in temp and assign it to res
6: Return res
