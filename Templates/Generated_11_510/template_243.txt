Input: lst: a list of tuples
Output: a list of tuples sorted based on the occurrence of the first element of tuples

1: Initialize an empty dictionary dct
2: For each tuple (i, j) in lst:
3:     Add i as a key in dct if it does not exist, and append j to the list of values for key i
4: Initialize an empty result list
5: For each key-value pair (i, j) in dct:
6:     Create a new tuple with i, the unique elements of j, and the length of j
7:     Append this new tuple to the result list
8: Return the result list
