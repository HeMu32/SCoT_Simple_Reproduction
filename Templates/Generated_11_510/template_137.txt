Output: ratio: the ratio of zeroes in nums  
1: Initialize n to the length of nums  
2: Initialize n1 to 0  
3: for each element x in nums:  
4:     if x is equal to 0:  
5:         increment n1 by 1  
6:     else:  
7:         do nothing  
8: return the ratio of n1 to n, rounded to 2 decimal places
