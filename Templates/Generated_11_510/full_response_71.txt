[BEGIN]
Input: nums: a list of numbers
Output: nums: a sorted list of numbers

1: Initialize shrink_fact to 1.3
2: Set gaps to the length of nums
3: Set swapped to True
4: Initialize i to 0
5: While gaps is greater than 1 or swapped is True:
6:     Update gaps to be the integer part of gaps divided by shrink_fact
7:     Set swapped to False
8:     Set i to 0
9:     While i plus gaps is less than the length of nums:
10:        If the element at index i in nums is greater than the element at index i plus gaps:
11:           Swap the elements at index i and i plus gaps in nums
12:           Set swapped to True
13:        Increment i by 1
14: Return nums
