Input: lst: a list of sublists  
Output: minLength: the minimum length of the sublists in lst  
1: Initialize minLength to the length of the first sublist in lst  
2: for each sublist x in lst:  
3:     if the length of x is less than minLength:  
4:         set minLength to the length of x  
5: return minLength
