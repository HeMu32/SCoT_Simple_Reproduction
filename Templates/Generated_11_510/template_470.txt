Input: test_tup: a tuple of integers  
Output: res: a tuple containing the pairwise addition of the elements of test_tup  
1: Initialize an empty list to store the results of pairwise addition  
2: Loop through the elements of test_tup and the elements of test_tup starting from the second element  
3:     For each pair of elements (i, j) from the two sequences:  
4:         Add i and j and append the result to the results list  
5: Convert the results list to a tuple  
6: Return the tuple of results
