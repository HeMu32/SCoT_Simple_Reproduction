Input: str: a string  
Output: A list of all permutations of the string, including duplicates  

1: If the length of str is 0, return a list containing an empty string  
2: Recursively call the function with the substring of str from the second character to the end, and store the result in prev_list  
3: Initialize an empty list next_list to store the permutations of the current string  
4: For each string in prev_list:  
5:     For each position in the current string:  
6:         Create a new string by inserting the first character of str at the current position in the string from prev_list  
7:         If the new string is not already in next_list, append it to next_list  
8: Return next_list
