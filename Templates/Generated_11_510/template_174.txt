Output: result: a dictionary where each key maps to a list of values

1: Initialize an empty dictionary named result
2: For each tuple (k, v) in the list l:
3:     If the key k is not already in the dictionary result:
4:         Add k to result with an empty list as its value
5:     Append the value v to the list associated with key k in result
6: Return the dictionary result
