Input: M: an integer representing the length of the sequence
Output: The number of sequences of length M with non-negative prefix sums that can be generated by given values

1: Calculate n as M divided by 2
2: Initialize a variable a to the result of the bin_coff function with parameters (2 * n, n)
3: Initialize a variable b to a divided by (n + 1)
4: Return b

Function bin_coff(n, r):
1: Initialize val to 1
2: If r is greater than (n - r), set r to (n - r)
3: For i from 0 to r - 1:
   4:   Set val to val multiplied by (n - i)
   5:   Set val to val divided by (i + 1)
6: Return val
