Input: deciNum: a decimal number  
Output: octalNum: the octal representation of deciNum  
1: Initialize octalNum to 0  
2: Initialize countval to 1  
3: Set dNo to deciNum (though dNo is not used in the procedure, it's part of the original code)  
4: While deciNum is not 0:  
5:     Calculate the remainder of deciNum divided by 8  
6:     Update octalNum by adding the product of remainder and countval  
7:     Multiply countval by 10  
8:     Perform integer division of deciNum by 8  
9: Return octalNum
