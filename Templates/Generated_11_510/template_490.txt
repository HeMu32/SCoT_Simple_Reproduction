Input: test_list: a list of tuples
Output: res: a set of symmetric tuples where the first element is less than the second element

1: Convert test_list to a set and find the intersection with a set of reversed tuples from test_list
2: Initialize an empty set res
3: For each tuple (a, b) in the intersection set:
4:     If a is less than b:
5:         Add the tuple (a, b) to res
6: Return res
