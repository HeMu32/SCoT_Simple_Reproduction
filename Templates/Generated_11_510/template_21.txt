Input: m: an integer representing the number of multiples to find
Input: n: an integer representing the number to find multiples of
Output: a list of the first m multiples of n

1: Initialize a list to store the multiples of n
2: Use a range function to generate numbers starting from n, up to (m+1)*n, with a step of n
3: Convert the range object to a list
4: Return the list of multiples
