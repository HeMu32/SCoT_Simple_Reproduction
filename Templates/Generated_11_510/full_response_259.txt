[BEGIN]
Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two tuples of tuples
Output: res: a tuple of tuples where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements from test_tup1 and test_tup2

1: Initialize an empty list to store the result tuples.
2: For each pair of inner tuples (tup1, tup2) from test_tup1 and test_tup2:
3:     Initialize an empty list to store the maximum elements of the current inner tuples.
4:     For each pair of elements (a, b) from tup1 and tup2:
5:         If a is greater than or equal to b:
6:             Add a to the list of maximum elements.
7:         Else:
8:             Add b to the list of maximum elements.
9:     Convert the list of maximum elements to a tuple and add it to the result list.
10: Convert the result list to a tuple.
11: Return the result tuple.
