Input: binary: an integer representing a binary number
Output: decimal: an integer representing the decimal equivalent of the binary number
1: Initialize variables decimal to 0, i to 0
2: While binary is not equal to 0:
3:     Calculate the remainder of binary divided by 10 and store it in dec
4:     Update decimal by adding dec multiplied by 2 raised to the power of i
5:     Update binary by performing integer division by 10
6:     Increment i by 1
7: Return decimal
