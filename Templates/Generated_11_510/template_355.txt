Input: radius: an integer representing the radius of the circle
Output: rectangles: the number of rectangles that can fit inside the circle

1: Initialize rectangles to 0
2: Calculate the diameter of the circle as 2 * radius
3: Calculate the square of the diameter (diameterSquare)
4: for a in range(1, 2 * radius):
5:     for b in range(1, 2 * radius):
6:         Calculate the square of the diagonal length of the rectangle (diagonalLengthSquare) as (a * a + b * b)
7:         if diagonalLengthSquare is less than or equal to diameterSquare:
8:             Increment rectangles by 1
9: return rectangles
