[BEGIN]
Input: n: an integer 
Output: maxPrime: the largest prime factor of n 
1: Initialize maxPrime to -1 
2: While n is divisible by 2: 
3:     Set maxPrime to 2 
4:     Right shift n by 1 (equivalent to dividing n by 2) 
5: For i from 3 to the square root of n, incrementing by 2: 
6:     While n is divisible by i: 
7:         Set maxPrime to i 
8:         Divide n by i 
9: If n is greater than 2: 
10:    Set maxPrime to n 
11: Return maxPrime
