Input: list1: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers
Output: result_max: the maximum product of the integers from the tuples in list1

1: Initialize an empty list to store the products of the tuples
2: For each tuple (x, y) in list1:
3:     Calculate the product of x and y
4:     Append the absolute value of the product to the products list
5: Find the maximum value in the products list
6: Return the maximum value as result_max
