Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the number of elements in arr
Output: The maximum absolute difference between any two elements in arr

1: Initialize minEle and maxEle with the first element of arr
2: Loop through the array starting from the second element to the nth element
3:     Update minEle to be the minimum of minEle and the current element
4:     Update maxEle to be the maximum of maxEle and the current element
5: After the loop, return the difference between maxEle and minEle
