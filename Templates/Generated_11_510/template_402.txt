Input: n: an integer, r: an integer, p: a prime number
Output: The value of nCr % p

1: Initialize a list C of size r+1 with all elements set to 0
2: Set the first element of C to 1
3: For each integer i from 1 to n (inclusive):
4:     For each integer j from min(i, r) down to 1 (inclusive):
5:         Update C[j] to (C[j] + C[j-1]) % p
6: Return the value of C[r]
