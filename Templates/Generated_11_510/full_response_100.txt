[BEGIN]
Input: num: an integer
Output: next_palindrome: the next smallest palindrome integer greater than num
1: Convert num to a string numstr
2: Start a loop from i = num + 1 to the maximum integer value (sys.maxsize)
3:     Convert i to a string
4:     Check if the string representation of i is equal to its reverse
5:     If it is, return i as the next smallest palindrome
6: If no palindrome is found (theoretically, this should not happen), the function will implicitly return None
