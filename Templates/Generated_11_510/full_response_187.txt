Input: X, Y: two sequences, m: length of X, n: length of Y
Output: Length of the longest common subsequence

1: if m is 0 or n is 0:
2:     return 0
3: if the last characters of X and Y are the same:
4:     return 1 + the result of the function called with the last characters removed from both X and Y
5: else:
6:     return the maximum of:
7:         the result of the function called with the last character removed from Y
8:         the result of the function called with the last character removed from X
