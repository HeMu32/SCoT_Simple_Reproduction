Input: n: integer, r: integer
Output: binomial coefficient: float

1: if r is greater than n divided by 2:
2:     set r to n minus r
3: initialize answer to 1
4: for i from 1 to r inclusive:
5:     multiply answer by (n - r + i)
6:     divide answer by i
7: return answer

Input: n: integer, k: integer, p: float
Output: binomial probability: float

1: compute the binomial coefficient using the nCr function
2: compute p to the power of k
3: compute (1 - p) to the power of (n - k)
4: multiply the binomial coefficient by the results of steps 2 and 3
5: return the result of step 4
