Input: arr: a list of strings, n: the number of strings in arr
Output: prefix: the longest common prefix among the strings in arr

1: Initialize prefix to the first string in arr
2: for i from 1 to n-1 do
3:     Call common_prefix_util with prefix and arr[i] and store the result in prefix
4: return prefix

common_prefix_util(str1, str2)
1: Initialize result to an empty string
2: Initialize n1 to the length of str1
3: Initialize n2 to the length of str2
4: Initialize i and j to 0
5: while i is less than or equal to n1 - 1 and j is less than or equal to n2 - 1 do
6:     if str1[i] is not equal to str2[j] then
7:         break
8:     Append str1[i] to result
9:     Increment i by 1
10:    Increment j by 1
11: return result
