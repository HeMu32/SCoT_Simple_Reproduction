Input: n: an integer
Output: an integer with all odd bits toggled
1: Initialize res to 0, count to 0, and temp to n
2: While temp is greater than 0:
3:     If count is even:
4:         Set res to res OR (1 shifted left by count positions)
5:     Increment count by 1
6:     Right shift temp by 1 position
7: Return n XOR res
