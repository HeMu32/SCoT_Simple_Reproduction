Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list, out_of_place: the index of the out-of-place element, cur: the current index
Output: arr: the list with elements rearranged to alternate between positive and negative

1: Initialize out_of_place to -1
2: Loop through the array from index 0 to n-1
3:     If out_of_place is greater than or equal to 0
4:         If the current element and the out_of_place element have opposite signs
5:             Call right_rotate to rotate the elements from the current index to the out_of_place index
6:             If the distance between the current index and out_of_place is greater than 2
7:                 Increment out_of_place by 2
8:             Else
9:                 Set out_of_place to -1
10:     If out_of_place is -1
11:         If the current element is positive and the index is even, or the current element is negative and the index is odd
12:             Set out_of_place to the current index
13: Return the rearranged array
