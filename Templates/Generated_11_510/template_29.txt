Input: arr: a list of integers, arr_size: the size of the list
Output: The element that occurs an odd number of times, or -1 if no such element exists

1: for each element in arr (using index i):
2:     initialize count to 0
3:     for each element in arr (using index j):
4:         if the element at index i is equal to the element at index j:
5:             increment count by 1
6:     if count is odd (count % 2 != 0):
7:         return the element at index i
8: return -1 (if no element occurs an odd number of times)
