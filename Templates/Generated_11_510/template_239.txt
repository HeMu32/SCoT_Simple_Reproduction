Input: m: an integer representing the maximum value of the sequence elements
Input: n: an integer representing the length of the sequence
Output: The total number of sequences of length n where each element is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m

1: Initialize a 2D list T with dimensions (m+1) x (n+1) and fill it with zeros.
2: For each value i from 0 to m (inclusive):
3:     For each value j from 0 to n (inclusive):
4:         If i is 0 or j is 0:
5:             Set T[i][j] to 0.
6:         Else if i is less than j:
7:             Set T[i][j] to 0.
8:         Else if j is 1:
9:             Set T[i][j] to i.
10:        Else:
11:            Set T[i][j] to the sum of T[i-1][j] and T[i//2][j-1].
12: Return the value of T[m][n].
