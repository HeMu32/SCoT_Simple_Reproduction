Input: test_list: a list of tuples, K: an integer
Output: res: a list of tuples where each tuple is trimmed by K elements from both ends

1: Initialize an empty list res to store the results
2: For each tuple ele in test_list:
3:     Calculate N as the length of the tuple ele
4:     Convert the tuple ele to a list, slice it from index K to N - K, and convert it back to a tuple
5:     Append the trimmed tuple to res
6: Return res as a string representation of the list of trimmed tuples
