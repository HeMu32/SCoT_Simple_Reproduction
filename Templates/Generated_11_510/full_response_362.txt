[BEGIN]
Input: nums: a list of items
Output: item: the item with the maximum occurrences in nums
1: Initialize max_val to 0
2: Initialize result to the first item in nums
3: for each item i in nums:
4:     Calculate the number of occurrences of i in nums and store it in occu
5:     if occu is greater than max_val:
6:         Update max_val to occu
7:         Update result to i
8: return result
