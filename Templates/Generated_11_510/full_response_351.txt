[BEGIN]
Input: arr: list of integers, n: length of arr, k: integer
Output: The first element in arr that occurs k times, or -1 if no such element exists

1: Initialize an empty dictionary count_map to store the count of each element in arr
2: Loop through each element in arr from index 0 to n-1
3:     If the current element is already in count_map, increment its count by 1
4:     Otherwise, add the current element to count_map with a count of 1
5: Loop through each element in arr from index 0 to n-1
6:     If the count of the current element in count_map is equal to k, return the current element
7: If no element occurs k times, return -1
