[BEGIN]
Input: item_list: a sorted list of items, item: the item to search for
Output: found: a boolean indicating whether the item is found in the list

1: Initialize first to 0
2: Initialize last to the length of item_list minus 1
3: Initialize found to False
4: While first is less than or equal to last and found is False:
5:     Calculate mid as the integer division of (first + last) by 2
6:     If item_list[mid] is equal to item:
7:         Set found to True
8:     Else:
9:         If item is less than item_list[mid]:
10:            Set last to mid - 1
11:        Else:
12:            Set first to mid + 1
13: Return found
