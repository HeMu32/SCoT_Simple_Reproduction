Input: test_list: a list of tuples, K: an integer
Output: a string representation of a list of tuples where each tuple has all elements divisible by K

1: Initialize an empty list res to store the resulting tuples.
2: For each tuple sub in test_list:
3:     Initialize a flag variable all_divisible to True.
4:     For each element ele in sub:
5:         If ele is not divisible by K:
6:             Set all_divisible to False and break the loop.
7:     If all_divisible is True:
8:         Append sub to res.
9: Convert res to a string and return it.
