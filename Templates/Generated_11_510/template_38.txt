Input: list1: a list of integers  
Output: result: the division of the first even number by the first odd number in the list  
1: Initialize first_even to -1  
2: Initialize first_odd to -1  
3: For each element el in list1:  
4:     If el is even (el % 2 == 0):  
5:         Set first_even to el  
6:         Break the loop  
7: For each element el in list1:  
8:     If el is odd (el % 2 != 0):  
9:         Set first_odd to el  
10:        Break the loop  
11: If first_even is not -1 and first_odd is not -1:  
12:     Return the division of first_even by first_odd  
13: Else:  
14:     Return None
