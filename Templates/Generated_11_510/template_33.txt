Input: N: a decimal number  
Output: B_Number: a binary number as an integer  

1: Initialize B_Number to 0  
2: Initialize cnt to 0  
3: While N is not equal to 0:  
4:     Calculate the remainder of N divided by 2 and store it in rem  
5:     Calculate 10 raised to the power of cnt and store it in c  
6:     Add the product of rem and c to B_Number  
7:     Update N to the integer division of N by 2  
8:     Increment cnt by 1  
9: Return B_Number
