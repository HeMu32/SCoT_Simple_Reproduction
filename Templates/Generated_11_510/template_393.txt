Input: input_list: a list of lists  
Output: max_length: the maximum length among all lists in input_list  
Output: max_list: the list with the maximum length in input_list  

1: Calculate the maximum length of the lists in input_list using a generator expression:
   1.1: For each list x in input_list:
   1.2:     Calculate the length of x
   1.3: Use the max function to find the maximum length from the lengths calculated in 1.2
2: Find the list with the maximum length in input_list using the max function with a key:
   2.1: Use a lambda function as the key that returns the length of each list i
   2.2: The max function will return the list with the maximum length based on the key
3: Return the maximum length and the list with the maximum length
