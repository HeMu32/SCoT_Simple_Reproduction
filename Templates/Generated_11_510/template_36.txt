Input: p, q, N: integers where p and q are the numerator and denominator of a fraction, and N is the position of the digit to find in the decimal part of the fraction.

Output: The nth digit in the decimal part of the fraction p/q.

1: Initialize a loop that continues while N is greater than 0.
2:     Decrement N by 1.
3:     Multiply p by 10.
4:     Calculate the integer division of p by q and store the result in res.
5:     Update p to be the remainder of p divided by q.
6: Return the value of res, which is the nth digit in the decimal part of the fraction p/q.
