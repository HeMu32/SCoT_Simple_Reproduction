Please understand the requirement and write a rough solving process. It starts with a input-output structure. You should use three basic structures to build the solving process, including sequences, branches, and loops. The necessary details should be written in natural languages.
And you'll need to put [BEGIN] before your solution and [DONE] after it.

[BEGIN]
Input: l: list 
Output: True or False 
1: 	for each element in l do 
2: 		if the element is greater than its previous element then 
3: 			l increases 
4: 		if the element is less than its previous element then 
5: 			l decreases 
6: 	if both increase and decrease then 
7: 		return False 
8: 	else 
9: 		return True 
[DONE]
