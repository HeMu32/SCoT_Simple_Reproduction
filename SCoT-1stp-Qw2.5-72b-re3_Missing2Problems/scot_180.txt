Input: slat, slon: starting latitude and longitude (in degrees)  
        elat, elon: ending latitude and longitude (in degrees)  
Output: distance: the distance between the two points in kilometers  

1: Import the math module to use trigonometric functions and the value of pi.
2: Convert the latitude and longitude from degrees to radians.
3: Calculate the differences in latitude and longitude.
4: Apply the Haversine formula to calculate the great-circle distance between the two points.
5: The Earth's radius is approximately 6371 kilometers, which is used in the distance calculation.
6: Return the calculated distance.
