[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: word: a string in snake_case format
Output: camelCase: a string in camelCase format

1: Initialize an empty string named camelCase to store the result.
2: Split the input string word by underscores to get a list of words.
3: For each word in the list:
4:     If it is the first word, append it to camelCase as is (lowercase).
5:     For all other words, capitalize the first letter and append the rest of the word to camelCase.
6: Return the camelCase string.
[END PROCESS]

def snake_to_camel(word):
    camelCase = ""
    words = word.split('_')
    for i, w in enumerate(words):
        if i == 0:
            camelCase += w.lower()
        else:
            camelCase += w.capitalize()
    return camelCase

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** Initialize an empty string `camelCase` to build the final camelCase string.
- **Step 2:** Split the input string `word` by underscores using the `split('_')` method, which returns a list of words.
- **Step 3:** Iterate over the list of words using a for loop.
- **Step 4:** If the current word is the first word in the list, append it to `camelCase` as is, ensuring it remains in lowercase.
- **Step 5:** For all other words, capitalize the first letter using the `capitalize()` method and append the rest of the word to `camelCase`.
- **Step 6:** Return the final `camelCase` string.

This approach ensures that the first word is in lowercase and all subsequent words have their first letter capitalized, which is the correct format for a camelCase string.
