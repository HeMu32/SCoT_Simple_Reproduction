Input: x1, y1, x2, y2: integers representing the coordinates of two opposite corners of a square
Output: count: the number of integral coordinates that lie strictly inside the square

1: Calculate the side length of the square by finding the absolute difference between x1 and x2 (or y1 and y2, since it's a square)
2: Subtract 1 from the side length to exclude the boundary points
3: If the side length is less than or equal to 1, return 0 because there are no points strictly inside the square
4: The number of integral points inside the square is the square of (side length - 1)
5: Return the count
