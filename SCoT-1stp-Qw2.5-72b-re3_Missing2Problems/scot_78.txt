Input: n: an integer
Output: count: the number of integers from 1 to n (inclusive) that have an odd number of set bits (1s) in their binary representation

1: Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of integers with an odd number of set bits.
2: For each integer `i` from 1 to n (inclusive):
3:     Convert `i` to its binary representation.
4:     Count the number of set bits (1s) in the binary representation of `i`.
5:     If the number of set bits is odd:
6:         Increment `count` by 1.
7: Return `count`.
