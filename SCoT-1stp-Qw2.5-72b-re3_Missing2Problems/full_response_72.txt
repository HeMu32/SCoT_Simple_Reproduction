[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the number can be represented as the difference of two squares

1: Check if n is less than 0; if so, return False since negative numbers cannot be represented as the difference of two squares.
2: If n is 0 or 1, return True as both can be represented as the difference of two squares (0 = 0^2 - 0^2, 1 = 1^2 - 0^2).
3: For numbers greater than 1, check if n is odd or a multiple of 4:
   - If n is odd, it can always be represented as the difference of two squares.
   - If n is a multiple of 4, it can also be represented as the difference of two squares.
   - If n is even but not a multiple of 4, it cannot be represented as the difference of two squares.
4: Return the result of the check.

### Explanation:
- **Step 1**: We first check if the number is negative. A negative number cannot be represented as the difference of two squares because the square of any real number is non-negative.
- **Step 2**: We handle the special cases where `n` is 0 or 1. Both 0 and 1 can be represented as the difference of two squares.
- **Step 3**: For numbers greater than 1, we check if the number is odd or a multiple of 4. This is based on the mathematical property that any odd number and any multiple of 4 can be expressed as the difference of two squares.
- **Step 4**: If the number is even but not a multiple of 4, it cannot be represented as the difference of two squares. This is because the difference of two squares of integers is always either odd or a multiple of 4.

This approach ensures that we correctly determine whether a given number can be represented as the difference of two squares.
