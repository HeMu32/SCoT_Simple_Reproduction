[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list1, list2: two lists of elements
Output: a new list containing elements from list1 that are not present in list2

1: Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the elements that are in list1 but not in list2.
2: Loop through each element in list1.
3: For each element, check if it is not in list2.
4: If the element is not in list2, append it to the `result` list.
5: After the loop ends, return the `result` list.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def remove_elements(list1, list2):
    result = []
    for element in list1:
        if element not in list2:
            result.append(element)
    return result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `remove_elements` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, as input. The goal is to create a new list that contains only the elements from `list1` that are not present in `list2`. This is achieved by iterating over each element in `list1` and checking if it is not in `list2`. If the element is not found in `list2`, it is added to the `result` list. Finally, the `result` list is returned, which contains the filtered elements. This approach ensures that all elements from `list1` that are also in `list2` are removed, and only the unique elements from `list1` are retained.
