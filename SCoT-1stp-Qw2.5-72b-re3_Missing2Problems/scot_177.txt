Input: L, R: two integers representing the range [L, R]
Output: A tuple (a, b) of two distinct integers such that their least common multiple (LCM) is within the range [L, R]

1: Initialize a variable `found` to False to track if a valid pair is found
2: Loop through each number `a` starting from L to R-1:
3:   Loop through each number `b` starting from a+1 to R:
4:     Calculate the LCM of `a` and `b`
5:     If the LCM is within the range [L, R]:
6:       Set `found` to True
7:       Store the pair (a, b)
8:       Break the inner loop
9:   If `found` is True, break the outer loop
10: If a valid pair is found, return the pair
11: If no valid pair is found, return None
