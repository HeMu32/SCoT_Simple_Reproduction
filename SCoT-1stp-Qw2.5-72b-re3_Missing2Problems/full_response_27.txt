[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list: a list of strings, where each string may contain digits and other characters
Output: new_list: a list of strings with all digits removed from each string

1: Initialize an empty list new_list to store the results
2: For each string (s) in the input list:
3:     Initialize an empty string new_s to store the processed string
4:     For each character (c) in the string s:
5:         If c is not a digit:
6:             Append c to new_s
7:     Append new_s to new_list
8: Return new_list

Explanation:
- The function `remove` takes a list of strings as input.
- It initializes an empty list `new_list` to store the results.
- It iterates over each string `s` in the input list.
- For each string, it initializes an empty string `new_s` to build the new string without digits.
- It then iterates over each character `c` in the string `s`.
- If the character `c` is not a digit (checked using `c.isdigit()`), it is appended to `new_s`.
- After processing all characters in the string `s`, the new string `new_s` is appended to `new_list`.
- Finally, the function returns `new_list`, which contains the original strings with all digits removed.
