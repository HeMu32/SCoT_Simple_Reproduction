Input: binary: a string representing a binary number
Output: decimal: an integer representing the decimal equivalent of the binary number

1: Initialize a variable decimal to 0 to store the decimal result.
2: Initialize a variable power to 0 to keep track of the current power of 2.
3: Reverse the binary string to process it from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.
4: For each character in the reversed binary string:
5:     If the character is '1':
6:         Add 2 raised to the power to the decimal variable.
7:     Increment the power by 1.
8: Return the decimal variable as the result.
