[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: x, y: two integers
Output: A boolean value indicating whether x and y have opposite signs

1: Check if the product of x and y is less than 0
2:   If the product is less than 0, return True (indicating opposite signs)
3:   Otherwise, return False (indicating same signs or one of them is zero)
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def opposite_Signs(x, y):
    return x * y < 0
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `opposite_Signs` takes two integers, `x` and `y`, as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the two integers have opposite signs. The logic is based on the property that the product of two numbers with opposite signs is negative. Therefore, if `x * y` is less than 0, the numbers have opposite signs, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the mathematical property of multiplication to determine the sign relationship between the two numbers.
