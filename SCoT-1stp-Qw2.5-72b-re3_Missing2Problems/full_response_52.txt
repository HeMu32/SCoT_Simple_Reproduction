[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: b: the base of the parallelogram, h: the height of the parallelogram
Output: area: the area of the parallelogram

1: Calculate the area of the parallelogram using the formula: area = base * height
2: Return the calculated area
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def parallelogram_area(b, h):
    area = b * h
    return area
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `parallelogram_area` calculates the area of a parallelogram given its base (`b`) and height (`h`). The area of a parallelogram is computed using the formula:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

This formula is straightforward and does not require any complex logic or loops. The function multiplies the base by the height and returns the result. This implementation is efficient and directly addresses the problem requirement.
