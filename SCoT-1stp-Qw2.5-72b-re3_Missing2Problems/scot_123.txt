Input: limit: an integer representing the upper limit of the range to check for amicable numbers
Output: sum_amicable: the sum of all amicable numbers within the range from 1 to the limit

1: Initialize a variable sum_amicable to 0 to store the sum of amicable numbers
2: for each number n from 2 to limit do
3:     Calculate the sum of proper divisors of n (sum_divisors_n)
4:     if sum_divisors_n is not equal to n and is less than or equal to limit then
5:         Calculate the sum of proper divisors of sum_divisors_n (sum_divisors_sum_divisors_n)
6:         if sum_divisors_sum_divisors_n equals n then
7:             n and sum_divisors_n are an amicable pair
8:             Add n to sum_amicable
9: return sum_amicable
