Input: n: an integer
Output: difference: the difference between the sum of even digits and the sum of odd digits in n

1: Initialize sum_even to 0 (to store the sum of even digits)
2: Initialize sum_odd to 0 (to store the sum of odd digits)
3: Convert n to a string to easily iterate through each digit
4: Loop through each character in the string representation of n:
5:     Convert the character back to an integer
6:     If the integer is even:
7:         Add the integer to sum_even
8:     Else:
9:         Add the integer to sum_odd
10: Calculate the difference as sum_even - sum_odd
11: Return the difference
