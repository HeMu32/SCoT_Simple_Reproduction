Input: n: an integer
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the number can be represented as the product of two squares.

1: Initialize a variable `i` to 0.
2: Loop while `i * i` is less than or equal to `n`:
3:     Calculate `j` as the square root of `n / (i * i)`.
4:     If `j` is an integer and `i * i * j * j` equals `n`:
5:         Return True, as `n` can be represented as the product of two squares.
6:     Increment `i` by 1.
7: If the loop completes without finding such `i` and `j`:
8:     Return False, as `n` cannot be represented as the product of two squares.

### Explanation:
The function `prod_Square` checks if a given number `n` can be expressed as the product of two squares. The approach is to iterate through possible values of `i` (starting from 0) and for each `i`, calculate `j` such that `i * i * j * j` equals `n`. If such `i` and `j` are found, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding such values, the function returns `False`.

- **Step 1:** Initialize `i` to 0.
- **Step 2:** Loop while `i * i` is less than or equal to `n`.
- **Step 3:** Calculate `j` as the square root of `n / (i * i)`.
- **Step 4:** Check if `j` is an integer and if `i * i * j * j` equals `n`.
- **Step 5:** If the condition in step 4 is met, return `True`.
- **Step 6:** Increment `i` by 1.
- **Step 7:** If the loop completes without finding such `i` and `j`, return `False`.

This approach ensures that we check all possible pairs of squares that could form the product `n`. The use of `math.sqrt` and `is_integer` helps in verifying if `j` is an integer, which is necessary for the product to be a perfect square.
