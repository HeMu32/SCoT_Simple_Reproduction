Input:
- `A`: a list of integers
- `n`: the length of the list `A`
- `sum`: the target sum for the triplet
- `count`: a variable to keep track of the number of triplets found

Output:
- `count`: the number of triplets in `A` that sum up to `sum`

1: Initialize `count` to 0
2: Use three nested loops to iterate through all possible triplets in the array `A`
3: For each triplet (i, j, k) where i < j < k:
4:     Calculate the sum of the triplet A[i] + A[j] + A[k]
5:     If the sum of the triplet equals the target `sum`:
6:         Increment `count` by 1
7: Return `count`
