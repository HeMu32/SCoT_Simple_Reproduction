Input: list: a list of numbers
Output: count: the number of positive numbers in the list

1: Initialize a counter variable to 0
2: Loop through each number in the list:
3:     If the number is greater than 0:
4:         Increment the counter by 1
5: Return the counter
[END PROCESS]

Explanation:
- The function `pos_count` takes a list of numbers as input.
- It initializes a counter variable `count` to 0, which will be used to keep track of the number of positive numbers in the list.
- The function then iterates over each number in the list using a for loop.
- Inside the loop, an if statement checks if the current number is greater than 0. If it is, the counter `count` is incremented by 1.
- After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `count`, which represents the total number of positive numbers in the list.
