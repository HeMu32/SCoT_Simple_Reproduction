[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_tup: a tuple of elements
Output: A list of tuples where each tuple is an inversion of the elements in the input tuple

1: Initialize an empty list `res` to store the result
2: For each element `ele` in `test_tup`:
3:     If `ele` is a tuple:
4:         Append the reversed `ele` to `res`
5:     Else:
6:         Append `ele` to `res` as it is
7: Return `res`

### Explanation:
The function `inversion_elements` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input. The goal is to invert the elements of the tuple if they are themselves tuples. If an element is not a tuple, it is appended to the result list as is. The function iterates over each element in the input tuple, checks if the element is a tuple, and if so, reverses it. The reversed tuple or the original element (if not a tuple) is then appended to the result list. Finally, the function returns the list of inverted or unchanged elements.
