Input: r: a float or integer representing the radius of the circle
Output: circumference: a float representing the circumference of the circle

1: Define the value of pi (π) as a constant (approximately 3.14159)
2: Calculate the circumference using the formula: circumference = 2 * π * r
3: Return the calculated circumference

### Explanation:
The function `circle_circumference` takes a single parameter `r`, which represents the radius of the circle. The circumference of a circle is calculated using the formula \( C = 2 \pi r \), where \( \pi \) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159. The function multiplies the radius by 2 and then by pi to get the circumference, and returns this value. This is a straightforward calculation that does not require any loops or branches, just a simple sequence of operations.
