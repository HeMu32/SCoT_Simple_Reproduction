Input: m: an integer representing the number of multiples to find, n: an integer representing the number to find multiples of
Output: A list of the first m multiples of n

1: Initialize an empty list to store the multiples
2: For i from 1 to m inclusive:
3:     Calculate the multiple by multiplying n by i
4:     Append the multiple to the list
5: Return the list of multiples
