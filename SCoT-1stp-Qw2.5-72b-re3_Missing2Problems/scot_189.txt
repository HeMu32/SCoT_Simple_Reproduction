Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list
Output: res: the first missing positive integer

1: Initialize a variable `i` to 0 for the current index
2: While `i` is less than `n`:
3:     Calculate the correct index `j` for the current element `arr[i]` as `arr[i] - 1`
4:     If `arr[i]` is positive, within the range of the array (1 to n), and not already in its correct position:
5:         Swap `arr[i]` with `arr[j]`
6:     Otherwise, move to the next element by incrementing `i`
7: After the loop, iterate through the array to find the first index `i` where `arr[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`
8: Return `i + 1` as the first missing positive integer
9: If no such index is found, return `n + 1` (all numbers from 1 to n are present)
