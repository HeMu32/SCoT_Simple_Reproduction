Input: colors: a list of colors, patterns: a list of pattern identifiers
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the colors follow the sequence given in the patterns array

1: Check if the lengths of the colors and patterns lists are the same. If not, return False.
2: Create a dictionary to map each pattern identifier to its corresponding color.
3: Iterate over the patterns and colors simultaneously.
4:   For each pattern identifier:
5:     If the pattern identifier is not in the dictionary, add it with the corresponding color.
6:     If the pattern identifier is in the dictionary, check if the mapped color matches the current color.
7:       If it does not match, return False.
8: If the loop completes without returning False, return True.
