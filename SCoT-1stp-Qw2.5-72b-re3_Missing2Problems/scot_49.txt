Input: nums: a two-dimensional list, N: an integer representing the index of the element to extract (0-based index)
Output: result: a list containing the first or specified element from each sublist in nums

1: Initialize an empty list called result
2: for each sublist in nums:
3:     if the length of the sublist is greater than N:
4:         append the element at index N of the sublist to result
5:     else:
6:         append None to result (to handle cases where the sublist is too short)
7: return result
