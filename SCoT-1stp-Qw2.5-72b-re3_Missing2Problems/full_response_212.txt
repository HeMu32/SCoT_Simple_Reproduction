[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer representing the number of natural numbers to consider
Output: the sum of the fourth powers of the first n natural numbers

1: Initialize a variable sum to 0
2: For i from 1 to n inclusive:
3:     Calculate the fourth power of i
4:     Add the fourth power of i to sum
5: Return sum
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def fourth_Power_Sum(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        sum += i ** 4
    return sum
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `fourth_Power_Sum(n)` calculates the sum of the fourth powers of the first `n` natural numbers. The process involves initializing a variable `sum` to 0, then iterating through each natural number from 1 to `n`. For each number `i`, it calculates `i` raised to the fourth power and adds this value to `sum`. After the loop completes, the function returns the total sum. This approach ensures that the function correctly computes the desired sum for any given positive integer `n`.
