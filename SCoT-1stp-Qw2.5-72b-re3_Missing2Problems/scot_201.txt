Input: lst: a list of elements
Output: A boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list are the same

1: Check if the list is empty or contains only one element, in which case return True as all (or the single) elements are the same.
2: Initialize a variable `first_element` with the first element of the list.
3: Loop through the list starting from the second element.
4:     If an element is not equal to `first_element`, return False.
5: If the loop completes without returning False, return True.
