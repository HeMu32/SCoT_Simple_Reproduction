[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: x: an integer number
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the number is a Keith number or not

1: Convert the number x into a list of its digits.
2: Determine the length of the list of digits, which will be the number of terms in the sequence.
3: Initialize a list with the digits of x as the starting sequence.
4: While the last element in the sequence is less than x:
5:     Calculate the next term by summing the last n terms of the sequence, where n is the length of the initial list of digits.
6:     Append the next term to the sequence.
7: If the last element of the sequence is exactly x, then x is a Keith number.
8: Return True if x is a Keith number, otherwise return False.

Explanation:
A Keith number is an integer N that, when its digits are used to form a Fibonacci-like sequence, N appears as a term in this sequence. The process involves:
- Converting the number into a list of its digits to determine the number of terms to sum for the next term in the sequence.
- Initializing a sequence with these digits.
- Generating the sequence by summing the last n terms (where n is the number of digits) and appending the sum to the sequence.
- Checking if the number x appears in the sequence. If it does, x is a Keith number; otherwise, it is not.
