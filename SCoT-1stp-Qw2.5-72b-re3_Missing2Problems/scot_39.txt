Input: S: a string
Output: True if the letters of the string can be rearranged so that no two adjacent characters are the same, otherwise False

1: Count the frequency of each character in the string using a dictionary
2: Find the maximum frequency of any character in the string
3: If the maximum frequency is more than half the length of the string plus one, return False (it's impossible to rearrange the string to meet the requirement)
4: Otherwise, return True (it's possible to rearrange the string to meet the requirement)

Explanation:
- The key insight is that if any character appears more than half the length of the string plus one, it is impossible to place this character in a way that it does not have the same character adjacent to it. For example, in a string of length 5, if a character appears 3 times, it's impossible to arrange the string so that no two of this character are adjacent.
- If no character appears more than half the length of the string plus one, it is always possible to rearrange the string to meet the requirement.
