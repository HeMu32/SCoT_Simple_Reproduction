Input: x, y: two integers
Output: the product of x and y

1: Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
2: Determine the sign of the result based on the signs of x and y.
3: Convert x and y to their absolute values.
4: Use a loop to add x to `result`, y times.
5: If the determined sign is negative, negate the `result`.
6: Return the `result`.
