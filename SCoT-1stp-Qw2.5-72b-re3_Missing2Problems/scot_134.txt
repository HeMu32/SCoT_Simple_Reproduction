Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list arr, p: the number of times the operation is to be performed
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the last element of the array is even or odd after p operations

1: Initialize last_element to the last element of arr
2: For i from 0 to p-1:
3:     For each element in arr:
4:         Increment the element by 1
5: After the loop, set last_element to the last element of arr
6: Check if last_element is even:
7:     If last_element % 2 == 0:
8:         Return True
9:     Else:
10:         Return False
