Input: a: the first term of the geometric series, n: the term number to find, r: the common ratio of the geometric series
Output: The n-th term of the geometric series

1: Calculate the n-th term using the formula for the n-th term of a geometric series: a * r^(n-1)
2: Return the calculated n-th term
