Certainly! Let's tackle the task of finding the Eulerian number \( a(n, m) \).

### Understanding the Requirement

The Eulerian number \( a(n, m) \) is a number that counts the number of permutations of the numbers from 1 to \( n \) in which exactly \( m \) elements are greater than the previous element. In other words, it counts the number of permutations of \( \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \) with exactly \( m \) ascents.

### Solving Process

[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer representing the length of the permutation, m: an integer representing the number of ascents
Output: a(n, m): the Eulerian number

1: If n is 0 or m is 0, return 0 (base case)
2: If m is 0 or m is n-1, return 1 (base case)
3: Initialize a 2D list dp of size (n+1) x (m+1) with all elements set to 0
4: Set dp[0][0] to 1 (base case)
5: for i from 1 to n do
6:     for j from 0 to m do
7:         if j is 0 then
8:             set dp[i][j] to 1
9:         else
10:            set dp[i][j] to dp[i-1][j-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-1][j]
11: return dp[n][m]
[END PROCESS]

### Code Implementation

[BEGIN CODE]
def eulerian_num(n, m):
    # Base cases
    if n == 0 or m == 0:
        return 0
    if m == 0 or m == n - 1:
        return 1

    # Initialize a 2D list dp with all elements set to 0
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(m + 1)] for _ in range(n + 1)]

    # Base case
    dp[0][0] = 1

    # Fill the dp table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(0, m + 1):
            if j == 0:
                dp[i][j] = 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + (i - 1) * dp[i - 1][j]

    return dp[n][m]
[END CODE]

### Explanation

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If \( n \) is 0 or \( m \) is 0, the Eulerian number is 0 because there are no permutations of length 0 or no ascents in a permutation of length 1.
   - If \( m \) is 0 or \( m \) is \( n-1 \), the Eulerian number is 1 because there is exactly one permutation with 0 ascents (the identity permutation) and one permutation with \( n-1 \) ascents (the reverse permutation).

2. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - We use a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the Eulerian number \( a(i, j) \).
   - We initialize the base case `dp[0][0]` to 1.
   - We fill the table using the recurrence relation:
     \[
     a(i, j) = a(i-1, j-1) + (i-1) \cdot a(i-1, j)
     \]
   - This recurrence relation accounts for the two ways to form a permutation with \( j \) ascents:
     - The last element is the largest and does not create an ascent.
     - The last element is not the largest and creates an ascent.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we return `dp[n][m]`, which is the Eulerian number \( a(n, m) \).

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the Eulerian number using dynamic programming, avoiding redundant calculations and ensuring correctness.
