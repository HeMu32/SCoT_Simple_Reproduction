Certainly! Let's break down the task and then implement the solution.

### Understanding the Requirement
An undulating number is a number that has the form `ababab...` or `bababa...`, where `a` and `b` are digits and `a` is not equal to `b`. For example, `121212` and `474747` are undulating numbers, while `123123` and `111111` are not.

### Solving Process
[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer
Output: True if n is an undulating number, False otherwise

1: Convert the integer n to a string to easily access individual digits
2: Check if the length of the string is less than 3:
3:     If true, return False (a number with less than 3 digits cannot be undulating)
4: Initialize two variables, a and b, to store the first and second digits of the string
5: If a is equal to b:
6:     Return False (a and b must be different for the number to be undulating)
7: Iterate through the string from the third digit to the end:
8:     For each digit at index i:
9:         If i is even and the digit is not equal to a:
10:            Return False
11:         If i is odd and the digit is not equal to b:
12:            Return False
13: Return True (if all checks pass, the number is undulating)
[END PROCESS]

### Code Implementation
[BEGIN CODE]
def is_undulating(n):
    # Convert the integer to a string
    s = str(n)
    
    # Check if the length of the string is less than 3
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Initialize the first and second digits
    a = s[0]
    b = s[1]
    
    # Check if the first and second digits are the same
    if a == b:
        return False
    
    # Iterate through the string from the third digit to the end
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != a:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != b:
            return False
    
    # If all checks pass, the number is undulating
    return True
[END CODE]

### Explanation
1. **Conversion to String**: We convert the integer `n` to a string `s` to easily access individual digits.
2. **Length Check**: We check if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, the number cannot be undulating, so we return `False`.
3. **First and Second Digits**: We initialize `a` and `b` to the first and second digits of the string, respectively.
4. **Equality Check**: We check if `a` and `b` are the same. If they are, the number cannot be undulating, so we return `False`.
5. **Loop Through Digits**: We iterate through the string starting from the third digit. For each digit at index `i`:
   - If `i` is even and the digit is not equal to `a`, we return `False`.
   - If `i` is odd and the digit is not equal to `b`, we return `False`.
6. **Return True**: If all checks pass, the number is undulating, so we return `True`.

This approach ensures that the number meets the criteria for being undulating.
