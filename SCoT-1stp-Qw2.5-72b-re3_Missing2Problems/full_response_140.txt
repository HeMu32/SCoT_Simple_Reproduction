Input: test_list: a list of tuples
Output: res: a list containing elements that occur exactly once in the entire list of tuples

1: Initialize an empty dictionary `freq_dict` to store the frequency of each element.
2: For each tuple `tup` in `test_list`:
3:     For each element `ele` in `tup`:
4:         If `ele` is not in `freq_dict`, add it with a count of 1.
5:         If `ele` is already in `freq_dict`, increment its count by 1.
6: Initialize an empty list `res` to store elements that occur exactly once.
7: For each key `k` in `freq_dict`:
8:     If the value of `k` in `freq_dict` is 1:
9:         Append `k` to `res`.
10: Return `res` as the list of elements that occur exactly once.

### Explanation:
The function `extract_singly` is designed to extract elements that occur exactly once in a given list of tuples. The process involves two main steps:

1. **Frequency Counting**: We first count the frequency of each element in the list of tuples using a dictionary. This is done by iterating over each tuple and then over each element in the tuple, updating the count in the dictionary.

2. **Filtering Single Occurrences**: After counting the frequencies, we iterate over the dictionary to find elements that have a count of 1. These elements are then added to the result list.

The function returns the list of elements that occur exactly once, providing a clear and concise solution to the problem.
