Input: list1, list2, list3: three lists of elements
Output: count: the number of pairs (x, y) that appear in all three lists

1: Initialize a counter variable count to 0.
2: Create a set from list1 to remove duplicates and allow for faster lookup.
3: Create a set from list2 to remove duplicates and allow for faster lookup.
4: Create a set from list3 to remove duplicates and allow for faster lookup.
5: For each element x in the set of list1:
6:     For each element y in the set of list2:
7:         If the pair (x, y) exists in the set of list3:
8:             Increment the counter by 1.
9: Return the counter.
