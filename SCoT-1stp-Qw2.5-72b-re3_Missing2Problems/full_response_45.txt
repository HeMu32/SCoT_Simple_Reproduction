[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: l: a list of integers
Output: The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the elements in the list

1: If the list is empty, return None (or raise an error, depending on the requirement)
2: Initialize a variable `gcd_result` with the first element of the list
3: For each element `num` in the list starting from the second element:
4:     Update `gcd_result` to be the GCD of `gcd_result` and `num`
5: Return `gcd_result`
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
from math import gcd

def get_gcd(l):
    if not l:  # Check if the list is empty
        return None  # Return None or raise an error if the list is empty
    
    gcd_result = l[0]  # Initialize gcd_result with the first element of the list
    
    for num in l[1:]:  # Iterate over the list starting from the second element
        gcd_result = gcd(gcd_result, num)  # Update gcd_result with the GCD of gcd_result and num
    
    return gcd_result  # Return the final GCD result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the input list `l` is empty. If it is, the function returns `None`. This is a common practice to handle edge cases and avoid errors.
2. **Initialization**: The variable `gcd_result` is initialized with the first element of the list. This will serve as the starting point for computing the GCD.
3. **Iterating and Updating GCD**: The function iterates over the list starting from the second element. For each element, it updates `gcd_result` to be the GCD of `gcd_result` and the current element. This is done using the `gcd` function from the `math` module.
4. **Returning the Result**: After the loop completes, the final value of `gcd_result` is returned, which is the GCD of all the elements in the list.

This approach ensures that the function correctly computes the GCD of the list elements in a straightforward and efficient manner.
