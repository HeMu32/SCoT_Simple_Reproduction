[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_tup: a tuple that may contain duplicate elements
Output: res: a tuple with duplicates removed

1: Convert the tuple to a set to remove duplicates, as sets do not allow duplicate elements.
2: Convert the set back to a tuple to match the required output format.
3: Return the resulting tuple.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def remove_tuple(test_tup):
    # Convert the tuple to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_set = set(test_tup)
    # Convert the set back to a tuple
    res = tuple(unique_set)
    return res
[END CODE]

Explanation:
- The function `remove_tuple` takes a single argument `test_tup`, which is a tuple that may contain duplicate elements.
- The function converts the tuple to a set using the `set()` constructor. Sets automatically remove any duplicate elements because they only store unique values.
- The resulting set is then converted back to a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor.
- Finally, the function returns the new tuple, which contains only the unique elements from the original tuple, with duplicates removed. The order of elements in the output tuple may differ from the original tuple due to the nature of sets, which do not maintain order. If maintaining the original order is required, a different approach would be necessary.
