Input: test_list: a list containing various elements, including tuples
       K: an integer representing the length of tuples to be removed
Output: A new list with all tuples of length K removed

1: Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the elements that are not tuples of length K.
2: Iterate through each element in `test_list`.
3: For each element:
   4: Check if the element is a tuple and its length is equal to K.
   5: If the element is not a tuple of length K, add it to the `result` list.
6: After the loop, return the `result` list.
