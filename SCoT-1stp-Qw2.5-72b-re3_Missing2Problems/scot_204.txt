1. **Input**: 
   - `s`: a string.
   - `c`: a character.

2. **Output**: 
   - An integer representing the number of times the character `c` appears in the string `s`.

3. **Steps**:
   - Initialize a variable `res` to 0. This variable will store the count of occurrences.
   - Iterate over each character in the string `s` using a loop.
   - For each character in `s`, check if it is equal to `c`.
   - If the character is equal to `c`, increment `res` by 1.
   - After the loop, return the value of `res`.
