[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: ratio: the ratio of zeroes in the list
1: Initialize a variable zero_count to 0 to keep track of the number of zeroes
2: Initialize a variable total_count to the length of the list to represent the total number of elements
3: Loop through each element in the list:
4:     If the element is 0, increment zero_count by 1
5: Calculate the ratio of zeroes by dividing zero_count by total_count
6: Return the ratio

### Explanation:
The function `zero_count` is designed to calculate the ratio of zeroes in a given list of integers. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `zero_count` is initialized to 0. This variable will keep track of how many zeroes are in the list.
   - `total_count` is initialized to the length of the list `nums`. This represents the total number of elements in the list.

2. **Loop through the list**:
   - A for loop iterates over each element in the list `nums`.
   - Inside the loop, an if statement checks if the current element is 0.
   - If the element is 0, `zero_count` is incremented by 1.

3. **Calculate the ratio**:
   - After the loop, the ratio of zeroes is calculated by dividing `zero_count` by `total_count`.

4. **Return the ratio**:
   - The function returns the calculated ratio.

This approach ensures that the function accurately computes the ratio of zeroes in the list, handling both cases where there are zeroes and where there are no zeroes.
