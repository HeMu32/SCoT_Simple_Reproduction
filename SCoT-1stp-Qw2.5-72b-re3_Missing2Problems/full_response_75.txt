[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_list: a list of tuples, K: an integer
Output: a list of tuples where all elements in each tuple are divisible by K

1: Initialize an empty list to store the result.
2: Iterate over each tuple in the test_list.
3: For each tuple, check if all elements are divisible by K.
   - If yes, add the tuple to the result list.
4: After iterating through all tuples, return the result list.
[END PROCESS]

        if all(x % K == 0 for x in tup):
            result.append(tup)
    return result

Explanation:
- The function `find_tuples` takes two parameters: `test_list`, which is a list of tuples, and `K`, which is an integer.
- An empty list `result` is initialized to store the tuples that meet the criteria.
- A loop iterates over each tuple in `test_list`.
- For each tuple, the `all` function is used to check if all elements in the tuple are divisible by `K`. The expression `x % K == 0` returns `True` if `x` is divisible by `K` and `False` otherwise. The `all` function returns `True` only if all elements in the tuple satisfy the condition.
- If the condition is met, the tuple is appended to the `result` list.
- After the loop completes, the `result` list is returned, containing only the tuples where all elements are divisible by `K`.
