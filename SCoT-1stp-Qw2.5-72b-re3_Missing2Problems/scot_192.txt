Input: str: a string
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the string has at least one letter and one number

1: Initialize two flags, `has_letter` and `has_number`, to False.
2: Loop through each character `ch` in the string `str`:
3:     If `ch` is a letter:
4:         Set `has_letter` to True.
5:     If `ch` is a number:
6:         Set `has_number` to True.
7:     If both `has_letter` and `has_number` are True:
8:         Break the loop as the condition is already met.
9: Return the result of `has_letter and has_number`.
