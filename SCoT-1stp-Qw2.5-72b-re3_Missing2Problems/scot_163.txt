Input: s: number of sides of the polygon, l: length of each side
Output: area: the area of the regular polygon

1: Calculate the apothem (a) of the polygon using the formula: a = l / (2 * tan(Ï€ / s))
2: Calculate the perimeter (p) of the polygon using the formula: p = s * l
3: Calculate the area (area) of the polygon using the formula: area = (p * a) / 2
4: Return the area
