Input: n: an octal number as a string
Output: decimal: the decimal equivalent of the octal number

1: Initialize `decimal` to 0
2: Initialize `base` to 1 (which is 8^0)
3: Iterate over the characters in the string `n` from the last character to the first:
4:     Convert the current character to an integer and store it in `digit`
5:     Add `digit * base` to `decimal`
6:     Multiply `base` by 8
7: Return `decimal`
