[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: arraynums: a list of integers
Output: True if the list contains any duplicate elements, False otherwise

1: Create a set from the list to remove any duplicates
2: Compare the length of the original list with the length of the set
3: If the lengths are different, return True (indicating duplicates are present)
4: If the lengths are the same, return False (indicating no duplicates)
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def test_duplicate(arraynums):
    # Create a set from the list to remove duplicates
    unique_nums = set(arraynums)
    
    # Compare the length of the original list with the set
    if len(arraynums) != len(unique_nums):
        return True  # Duplicates are present
    else:
        return False  # No duplicates
[END CODE]

**Explanation:**
The function `test_duplicate` checks for duplicate elements in a list of integers. It does this by converting the list into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements. By comparing the length of the original list with the length of the set, we can determine if any duplicates were present. If the lengths differ, it means there were duplicates in the original list, and the function returns `True`. If the lengths are the same, it means there were no duplicates, and the function returns `False`. This method is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the properties of sets in Python.
