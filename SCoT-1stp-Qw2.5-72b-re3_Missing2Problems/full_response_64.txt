[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: subjectmarks: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a subject name and a mark
Output: sorted_subjectmarks: the list of tuples sorted by marks in descending order

1: Use the `sorted` function to sort the list of tuples.
2: The `sorted` function takes a key parameter, which is a function to extract a comparison key from each input element.
3: Use a lambda function as the key parameter to extract the mark from each tuple.
4: Set the `reverse` parameter to True to sort the list in descending order.
5: Return the sorted list.

[BEGIN CODE]
def subject_marks(subjectmarks):
    # Sort the list of tuples based on the second element (marks) in descending order
    sorted_subjectmarks = sorted(subjectmarks, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return sorted_subjectmarks
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `subject_marks` takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple consists of a subject name and a mark. The goal is to sort this list based on the marks in descending order. To achieve this, the `sorted` function is used with a lambda function as the key to extract the mark from each tuple. The `reverse=True` parameter ensures that the sorting is done in descending order. The sorted list is then returned.
