[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: lst: a list of elements
Output: A boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list are the same

1: Check if the list is empty or contains only one element, in which case return True as all (or the single) elements are the same.
2: Initialize a variable `first_element` with the first element of the list.
3: Loop through the list starting from the second element.
4:     If an element is not equal to `first_element`, return False.
5: If the loop completes without returning False, return True.
[END PROCESS]

### Explanation:
The function `chkList` checks if all elements in a given list are the same. It first handles edge cases where the list is empty or contains only one element, returning `True` in these cases since there are no different elements to compare. For lists with more than one element, it compares each element to the first element. If any element is different, it immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any different elements, it returns `True`, indicating that all elements in the list are the same.
