Input: test_list: a list of integers, strt_val: an integer representing the start of the range, stop_val: an integer representing the end of the range
Output: missing_ranges: a list of tuples, each representing a range of missing numbers

1: Initialize an empty list missing_ranges to store the ranges of missing numbers.
2: Create a set of numbers from the given range using strt_val and stop_val to allow for O(1) lookups.
3: Iterate over the set of numbers from strt_val to stop_val.
4:     If the current number is not in test_list:
5:         Check if the next number is also not in test_list to determine if it's the start of a new range.
6:         If it is the start of a new range, record the start and continue checking subsequent numbers until a number is found in test_list or the end of the range is reached.
7:         Record the end of the range and add the range (start, end) to missing_ranges.
8: Return the list missing_ranges.
