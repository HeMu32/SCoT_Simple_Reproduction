Input: test_tup: a tuple of elements
Output: A list of tuples where each tuple is an inversion of the elements in the input tuple

2: For each element `ele` in `test_tup`:
3:     If `ele` is a tuple:
4:         Append the reversed `ele` to `res`
5:     Else:
6:         Append `ele` to `res` as it is
7: Return `res`
