def tn_gp(a, n, r):

### Explanation:
The function `tn_gp` is designed to calculate the n-th term of a geometric series. In a geometric series, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. The formula to find the n-th term of a geometric series is given by:

\[ a_n = a \cdot r^{(n-1)} \]

Where:
- \( a \) is the first term of the series.
- \( r \) is the common ratio.
- \( n \) is the term number.

The function takes three parameters:
- `a`: the first term of the geometric series.
- `n`: the term number to find.
- `r`: the common ratio of the geometric series.

The function calculates the n-th term using the formula and returns the result. This implementation is straightforward and directly applies the mathematical formula to compute the desired term.
