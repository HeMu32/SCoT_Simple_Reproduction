Input: n: an integer greater than 1
Output: largest_prime: the largest prime factor of n
1: Initialize largest_prime to -1 (to handle the case where n is 1 or no prime factors are found)
2: While n is even, divide n by 2 and set largest_prime to 2
3: For i from 3 to the square root of n, incrementing by 2 (to check only odd numbers):
4:     While i divides n, divide n by i and set largest_prime to i
5: If n is a prime number greater than 2, set largest_prime to n
6: Return largest_prime
