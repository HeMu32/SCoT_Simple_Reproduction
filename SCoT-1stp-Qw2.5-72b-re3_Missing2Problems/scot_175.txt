Input: str1: a string containing parentheses
Output: Boolean value indicating whether the string of parentheses is valid

1: Initialize an empty stack to keep track of opening parentheses
2: for each character in str1 do
3:     if the character is an opening parenthesis (i.e., '(', '{', '[') then
4:         push the character onto the stack
5:     else if the character is a closing parenthesis (i.e., ')', '}', ']') then
6:         if the stack is empty then
7:             return False (unmatched closing parenthesis)
8:         else
9:             pop the top element from the stack
10:            if the popped element does not match the current closing parenthesis then
11:                return False (mismatched parentheses)
12: if the stack is not empty then
13:     return False (unmatched opening parentheses)
14: return True (all parentheses are matched)
