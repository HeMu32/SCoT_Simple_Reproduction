[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: tup1: a tuple of elements (can be of any type that can be converted to a string)
Output: A string representation of the tuple, with elements concatenated together without any separators.

1: Initialize an empty string `result`.
2: Iterate over each element `e` in the tuple `tup1`.
3: Convert the element `e` to a string and concatenate it to `result`.
4: Return the `result` string.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def tup_string(tup1):
    result = ""
    for e in tup1:
        result += str(e)
    return result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `tup_string` takes a tuple `tup1` as input and converts it into a string where all the elements of the tuple are concatenated together. The elements of the tuple can be of any type, but they must be convertible to a string using the `str()` function. The function iterates over each element in the tuple, converts it to a string, and appends it to the `result` string. Finally, the concatenated string is returned. This approach ensures that all elements are included in the final string representation, and no separators are added between the elements.
