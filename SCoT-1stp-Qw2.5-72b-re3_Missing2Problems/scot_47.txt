Input: A, B: two integers where 0 <= A <= B
Output: last_digit: the last digit of the result when factorial of A divides factorial of B

1: Define a function to calculate the factorial of a number, which will be used to calculate the factorials of A and B.
2: Calculate the factorial of A and B using the defined factorial function.
3: Compute the division of the factorial of B by the factorial of A.
4: Convert the result of the division to a string to easily access the last character, which represents the last digit.
5: Convert the last character of the string back to an integer.
6: Return the last digit as the result.
