Input: strr: a string  
Output: result_char: a character representing the sum of the ASCII values of all characters in the string, converted back to a character  
1: Initialize a variable `total` to 0 to store the sum of ASCII values  
2: For each character `c` in the string `strr`:  
3:     Add the ASCII value of `c` to `total`  
4: Compute the result character by converting `total` back to a character using `chr`  
5: Return the result character

Explanation:
The function `get_Char` takes a string `strr` as input and returns a single character. This character is determined by summing the ASCII values of all characters in the input string and then converting this sum back into a character using the `chr` function. The `ord` function is used to get the ASCII value of each character in the string. The loop iterates over each character in the string, adding its ASCII value to the `total`. After the loop, the `total` is converted to a character, which is then returned as the result. This approach ensures that the function meets the requirement of finding the character made by adding all the characters of the given string.
