[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_tup: a tuple containing elements that can be concatenated (e.g., strings, numbers, etc.)
Output: result: a new tuple where each element is the concatenation of adjacent elements from the input tuple

1: Initialize an empty list `result` to store the concatenated elements.
2: Iterate over the elements of `test_tup` using a loop, but stop one element before the end to avoid index out of range errors.
3: For each element, concatenate it with the next element in the tuple and append the result to the `result` list.
4: Convert the `result` list back into a tuple.
5: Return the `result` tuple.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def concatenate_elements(test_tup):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(test_tup) - 1):
        # Concatenate the current element with the next element
        concatenated_element = str(test_tup[i]) + str(test_tup[i + 1])
        result.append(concatenated_element)
    # Convert the result list back into a tuple
    result = tuple(result)
    return result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `concatenate_elements` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the concatenation of adjacent elements from the input tuple. The process involves iterating through the tuple, stopping one element before the end to avoid an index out of range error. During each iteration, the current element and the next element are concatenated and appended to a list. Finally, the list is converted back to a tuple and returned. This approach ensures that the function works for tuples of any length and with elements that can be converted to strings for concatenation.
