Input: nums: a list of lists of sorted and distinct integers, k: an integer representing the number of top frequent integers to return
Output: A list of the top k integers that occur most frequently in the given lists

1: Initialize an empty dictionary `freq` to store the frequency of each integer.
2: Loop through each list in `nums`:
3:     For each integer in the list, increment its count in `freq`.
4: Convert the dictionary `freq` into a list of tuples, where each tuple is (integer, frequency).
5: Use a heap queue (priority queue) to find the top k elements based on their frequency.
6: Extract the integers from the top k elements and return them as a list.
