Input: s: a binary string, n: an integer representing the length of the string
Output: count: the number of rotations of the string that result in an odd binary number

1: Initialize count to 0
2: Loop i from 0 to n-1 (inclusive)
3:     Rotate the string s to the left by i positions
4:     Convert the rotated string to an integer
5:     If the integer is odd, increment count by 1
6: Return count
