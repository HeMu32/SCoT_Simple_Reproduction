Input: r: a float or integer representing the radius of the circle
Output: circumference: a float representing the circumference of the circle

1: Define the value of pi (π) as a constant (approximately 3.14159)
2: Calculate the circumference using the formula: circumference = 2 * π * r
3: Return the calculated circumference
