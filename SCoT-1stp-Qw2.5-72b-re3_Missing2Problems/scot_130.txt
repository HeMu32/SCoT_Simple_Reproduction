Input: nums: a list of items (can be numbers, strings, etc.)
Output: item: the item with the maximum frequency in the list
1: Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each item
2: Loop through each item in the list nums
3:     If the item is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
4:     If the item is already in the dictionary, increment its count by 1
5: Initialize a variable max_count to 0 and max_item to None
6: Loop through each key-value pair (item, count) in the dictionary
7:     If the count is greater than max_count, update max_count to count and max_item to item
8: Return max_item
