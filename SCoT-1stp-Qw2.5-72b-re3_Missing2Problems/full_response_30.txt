[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: s: a string
Output: count: the number of substrings that start and end with the same character

1: Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of valid substrings.
2: Iterate through each character in the string using a loop.
3: For each character, check all possible substrings that start with this character.
4: For each substring, check if it ends with the same character it started with.
5: If the substring meets the condition, increment the `count` by 1.
6: After checking all possible substrings, return the `count`.
[END PROCESS]

### Explanation:
The function `count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends` is designed to count all substrings within a given string `s` that start and end with the same character. The process involves two nested loops:
- The outer loop iterates through each character in the string, treating each character as the starting point of potential substrings.
- The inner loop generates all possible substrings starting from the current character and checks if the substring ends with the same character it started with.
- If the condition is met, the `count` is incremented.
- Finally, the function returns the total count of such substrings.

This approach ensures that all possible substrings are checked, and the count is accurate. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the length of the string, due to the nested loops. This is efficient enough for strings of moderate length.
