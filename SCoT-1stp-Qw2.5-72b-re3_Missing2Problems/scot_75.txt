Input: test_list: a list of tuples, K: an integer
Output: a list of tuples where all elements in each tuple are divisible by K

1: Initialize an empty list to store the result.
2: Iterate over each tuple in the test_list.
3: For each tuple, check if all elements are divisible by K.
   - If yes, add the tuple to the result list.
4: After iterating through all tuples, return the result list.
