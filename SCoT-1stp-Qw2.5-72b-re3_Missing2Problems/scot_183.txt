Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list, k: the difference to find between pairs
Output: count: the number of distinct pairs (i, j) such that arr[i] - arr[j] = k or arr[j] - arr[i] = k

1: Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the number of valid pairs.
2: Create a set from the array to remove duplicates and allow for O(1) look-up times.
3: For each element x in the set:
4:     If the element (x + k) is also in the set:
5:         Increment count by 1.
6: Return count.
