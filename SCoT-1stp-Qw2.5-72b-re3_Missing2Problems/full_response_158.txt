[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list, k: the number of operations
Output: The minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal, or -1 if it's not possible with the given number of operations.

1: If the array is empty or has only one element, return 0 since no operations are needed.
2: Sort the array to find the median, which is the optimal target value to minimize the number of operations.
3: Calculate the total number of operations required to make all elements equal to the median.
4: If the total number of operations is less than or equal to k, return the total number of operations.
5: Otherwise, return -1 as it's not possible to make all elements equal with the given number of operations.

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** The function first checks if the array has 0 or 1 element. If so, it returns 0 because no operations are needed to make all elements equal.
- **Step 2:** The array is sorted to find the median. The median is chosen because it minimizes the total number of operations required to make all elements equal.
- **Step 3:** The total number of operations required to make all elements equal to the median is calculated by summing the absolute differences between each element and the median.
- **Step 4:** If the total number of operations is less than or equal to the allowed number of operations `k`, the function returns the total number of operations.
- **Step 5:** If the total number of operations exceeds `k`, the function returns -1, indicating that it's not possible to make all elements equal with the given number of operations.
