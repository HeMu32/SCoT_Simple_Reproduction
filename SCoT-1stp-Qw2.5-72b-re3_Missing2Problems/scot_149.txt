Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list
Output: The length of the longest subsequence where the difference between adjacent elements is one.

1: Initialize a variable `max_length` to store the maximum length of the subsequence found so far, set it to 1.
2: Initialize a variable `current_length` to store the length of the current subsequence being checked, set it to 1.
3: Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element:
4:     If the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element is 1:
5:         Increment `current_length` by 1.
6:         If `current_length` is greater than `max_length`:
7:             Update `max_length` to `current_length`.
8:     Else:
9:         Reset `current_length` to 1.
10: Return `max_length`.
