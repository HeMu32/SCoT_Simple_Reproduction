[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_list: a list of tuples
Output: index: the index of the tuple with the minimum value in the list

1: Initialize a variable min_value to None to keep track of the minimum value found
2: Initialize a variable index to -1 to keep track of the index of the tuple with the minimum value
3: Loop through the list of tuples with both the index and the tuple itself
4:     If min_value is None or the current tuple's value is less than min_value:
5:         Update min_value to the current tuple's value
6:         Update index to the current index
7: After the loop, return index

Explanation:
- The function `index_minimum` takes a list of tuples as input.
- It initializes `min_value` to `None` and `index` to `-1`. `min_value` will store the minimum value found in the tuples, and `index` will store the index of the tuple containing this minimum value.
- The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over the list of tuples, using `enumerate` to get both the index and the tuple itself.
- Inside the loop, it checks if `min_value` is `None` (which is true for the first iteration) or if the current tuple's value (assumed to be the first element of the tuple) is less than `min_value`.
- If either condition is true, it updates `min_value` to the current tuple's value and `index` to the current index.
- After the loop completes, the function returns the `index` of the tuple with the minimum value.
- This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies the index of the tuple with the smallest value, even if the list is empty or contains tuples with non-numeric values.
