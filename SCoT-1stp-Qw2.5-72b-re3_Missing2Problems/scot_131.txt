Input: str1: a string
Output: A new string with only the vowels reversed

1: Initialize an empty list `vowels` to store the vowels found in the string.
2: Initialize an empty list `result` to store the characters of the new string.
3: Loop through each character `ch` in the string `str1`:
4:     If `ch` is a vowel (either uppercase or lowercase):
5:         Append `ch` to the `vowels` list.
6: Initialize an index `vowel_index` to the last position of the `vowels` list.
7: Loop through each character `ch` in the string `str1` again:
8:     If `ch` is a vowel:
9:         Append the vowel at `vowel_index` in the `vowels` list to `result`.
10:        Decrement `vowel_index` by 1.
11:    Else:
12:        Append `ch` to `result`.
13: Join the characters in `result` to form a new string.
14: Return the new string.
