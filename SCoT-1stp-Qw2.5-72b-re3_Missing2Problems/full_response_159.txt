Input: month: a string representing the month, days: an integer representing the day of the month
Output: season: a string representing the season for the given month and day
1: Convert the month to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity
2: Initialize season as an empty string
3: Use a series of if-elif-else statements to determine the season based on the month and day
4: For each month, check if the day falls within the range that defines the transition between seasons
5: Assign the appropriate season based on the month and day
6: Return the season

### Explanation:
The function `month_season` takes two parameters: `month` and `days`. The `month` parameter is a string representing the month, and `days` is an integer representing the day of the month. The function returns a string indicating the season for the given month and day.

1. **Case Insensitivity**: The month is converted to lowercase to ensure that the function works regardless of the case of the input month.
2. **Season Determination**: The function uses a series of `if-elif-else` statements to determine the season based on the month and day. Each month is checked to see if it falls within a specific range that defines the transition between seasons.
3. **Transition Days**: For months that have a transition day (e.g., March 20, June 21, September 22, December 21), the function checks if the day is before or after the transition day to determine the correct season.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the determined season as a string.

This approach ensures that the function accurately identifies the season for any given month and day.
