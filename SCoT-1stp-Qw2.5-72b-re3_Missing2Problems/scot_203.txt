Input: x, y: two integers
Output: distance: the Hamming distance between x and y

1: Convert integers x and y to their binary representations
2: Ensure both binary strings are of the same length by padding with leading zeros if necessary
3: Initialize a variable `distance` to 0 to keep track of the Hamming distance
4: For each bit in the binary strings:
5:     If the bits at the current position are different:
6:         Increment `distance` by 1
7: Return the `distance`
