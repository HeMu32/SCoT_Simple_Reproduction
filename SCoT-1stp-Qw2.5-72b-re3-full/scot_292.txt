Input: n, m: integers
Output: quotient: the quotient of n divided by m

1: Check if m is not zero to avoid division by zero error
2: If m is zero, raise an error or return a specific message indicating that division by zero is not allowed
3: If m is not zero, calculate the quotient of n divided by m using integer division
4: Return the quotient
