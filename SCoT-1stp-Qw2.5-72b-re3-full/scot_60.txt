Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of arr
Output: ans: the maximum length of the subsequence with the difference between adjacent elements being 1

1: Initialize a dictionary `dp` to store the maximum length of subsequence ending with a specific number.
2: Initialize a variable `max_len` to 1, as the minimum length of any subsequence is 1.
3: For each element `num` in `arr`:
4:     If `num - 1` is in `dp`, then the current element can extend the subsequence ending with `num - 1`.
5:     Update `dp[num]` to be `dp[num - 1] + 1` if `num - 1` is in `dp`, otherwise set `dp[num]` to 1.
6:     Update `max_len` to be the maximum of `max_len` and `dp[num]`.
7: Return `max_len` as the result.
