Input: alist: a list of elements (can be of any type)
Output: a list of tuples where each tuple represents a consecutive sequence of the same element in the input list. The first element of the tuple is the count of consecutive occurrences, and the second element is the value of the element.

1: Initialize an empty list to store the result (encoded_list)
2: Initialize a variable to keep track of the current element (current_element) and its count (count)
3: Loop through each element in the input list (alist)
4:     If the current element is the same as the last element (current_element):
5:         Increment the count
6:     Else:
7:         If the count is greater than 1:
8:             Append a tuple (count, current_element) to the encoded_list
9:         Else:
10:            Append the current_element to the encoded_list
11:        Reset the count to 1 and set current_element to the current element
12: After the loop, handle the last element:
13:    If the count is greater than 1:
14:        Append a tuple (count, current_element) to the encoded_list
15:    Else:
16:        Append the current_element to the encoded_list
17: Return the encoded_list

### Explanation:
The function `modified_encode` performs a modified run-length encoding on the input list `alist`. The encoding process is as follows:
- It iterates through the list, tracking the current element and its count.
- When a different element is encountered, it checks if the count is greater than 1. If so, it appends a tuple `(count, current_element)` to the result list. If the count is 1, it appends the element itself.
- After the loop, it handles the last element in the list in the same way.
- The function returns the encoded list, which represents the modified run-length encoding of the input list.
