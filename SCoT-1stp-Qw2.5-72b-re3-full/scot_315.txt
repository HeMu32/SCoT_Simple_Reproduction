Input: str: a string containing words separated by spaces
Output: The length of the first longest word that has an even number of characters. If no such word exists, return -1.

1: Split the string into a list of words.
2: Initialize a variable max_len to -1 to keep track of the maximum length of an even word found.
3: Loop through each word in the list:
4:     Calculate the length of the current word.
5:     If the length is even and greater than max_len:
6:         Update max_len to the length of the current word.
7:         Break the loop as we are looking for the first maximum length even word.
8: Return max_len.
