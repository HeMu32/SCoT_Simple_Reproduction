Input: array_nums: a list of integers
Output: count: the number of odd elements in the list

1: Use the `filter` function to apply a lambda function to each element in array_nums.
2:     The lambda function checks if an element is odd by using the modulus operator (%). If the element modulo 2 is not equal to 0, it is odd.
3: Convert the filter object to a list to get a list of all odd elements.
4: Use the `len` function to count the number of elements in the list of odd elements.
5: Return the count.
