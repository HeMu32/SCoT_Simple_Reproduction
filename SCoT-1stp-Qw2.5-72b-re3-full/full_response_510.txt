### Explanation:
The function `no_of_subsequences` calculates the number of subsequences in the given array `arr` where the product of the elements in each subsequence is less than a given threshold `k`.

1. **Initialization**: The variable `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of valid subsequences.

2. **Generating Subsequences**: The function uses the `combinations` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible subsequences of the array `arr`. The `combinations` function is called for each possible length `r` from 1 to the length of `arr`.

3. **Calculating Product**: For each subsequence, the function `product_of_elements` is called to calculate the product of the elements in the subsequence. This function multiplies all elements in the subsequence and returns the result.

4. **Checking Condition**: If the product of the elements in the subsequence is less than `k`, the `count` is incremented by 1.

5. **Returning Result**: After all subsequences have been checked, the function returns the `count` of valid subsequences.

This approach ensures that all possible subsequences are considered, and the product of each subsequence is checked against the threshold `k`. The use of `combinations` simplifies the generation of subsequences, making the solution both clear and efficient.
