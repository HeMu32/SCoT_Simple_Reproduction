Input: text: a string  
Output: match: a boolean indicating whether the last word in the string is followed by optional punctuation  

1: Remove any leading or trailing whitespace from the text.  
2: Split the text into words using whitespace as the delimiter.  
3: If the text is empty or does not contain any words:  
4:     Return False  
5: Initialize a variable last_word to the last element of the words list.  
6: Initialize a variable punctuation to an empty string.  
7: While the last character of last_word is a punctuation mark:  
8:     Remove the last character from last_word and append it to punctuation.

### Explanation:
The function `text_match_word` is designed to determine if the last word in a string is followed by optional punctuation. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Trimming Whitespace**: The function starts by trimming any leading or trailing whitespace from the input string using `strip()`. This ensures that the string is clean and ready for processing.

2. **Splitting the Text**: The text is then split into a list of words using `split()`, which splits the string at each whitespace character. This allows us to handle each word individually.

3. **Handling Empty Input**: If the text is empty or does not contain any words (i.e., the list of words is empty), the function returns `False` immediately.

4. **Extracting the Last Word**: The last word in the list is extracted and stored in the variable `last_word`.

5. **Removing Trailing Punctuation**: A loop is used to remove any trailing punctuation from the last word. Each punctuation character is removed from the end of `last_word` and appended to the `punctuation` string.

6. **Checking the Last Word**: After removing the punctuation, the function checks if the remaining part of `last_word` is a valid word (i.e., contains only letters). This is done using the `isalpha()` method, which returns `True` if all characters in the string are alphabetic.

7. **Returning the Result**: If the last word is a valid word, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach ensures that the function accurately matches a word at the end of a string, even if it is followed by optional punctuation.
