Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: differences: a list of integers representing the differences between consecutive numbers in the input list
1: Initialize an empty list to store the differences
2: Use a loop to iterate over the list, starting from the first element and ending at the second-to-last element
3:     for each element (except the last one):
4:         calculate the difference between the current element and the next element
5:         append the difference to the differences list
6: Return the differences list
