[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: rownum, colnum: two integers representing the number of rows and columns for the two-dimensional array
Output: A two-dimensional array (list of lists) with the specified number of rows and columns

1: Initialize an empty list `result` to store the two-dimensional array
2: Start a loop to iterate `rownum` times (for each row)
3:     Inside the row loop, initialize an empty list `row` to store the current row
4:     Start a loop to iterate `colnum` times (for each column in the current row)
5:         Inside the column loop, append a default value (e.g., 0) to `row`
6:     After the column loop, append the `row` to `result`
7: After the row loop, return the `result` as the two-dimensional array

### Explanation:
The function `multi_list` is designed to generate a two-dimensional array (a list of lists) with a specified number of rows and columns. The function takes two parameters, `rownum` and `colnum`, which represent the number of rows and columns, respectively.

1. **Initialization**: An empty list `result` is initialized to store the final two-dimensional array.
2. **Row Loop**: A loop runs `rownum` times, each iteration representing a new row in the array.
3. **Column Loop**: Inside the row loop, another loop runs `colnum` times, each iteration representing a new column in the current row.
4. **Appending Values**: In the column loop, a default value (0) is appended to the current row.
5. **Building Rows**: After the column loop completes, the current row (a list of default values) is appended to the `result` list.
6. **Returning the Result**: Once all rows have been processed, the `result` list, which now contains the two-dimensional array, is returned.

This approach ensures that the function generates a two-dimensional array with the specified dimensions, where each element is initialized to a default value (0 in this case).
