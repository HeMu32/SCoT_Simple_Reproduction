Input: l: a list of integers
Output: True if the list contains consecutive numbers, False otherwise

1: If the list is empty or has only one element, return False since there are no consecutive numbers to compare.
2: Sort the list to ensure that all potential consecutive numbers are adjacent.
3: Loop through the sorted list from the first element to the second-to-last element.
4:     If the current element plus one is not equal to the next element, return False.
5: If the loop completes without returning False, return True.
