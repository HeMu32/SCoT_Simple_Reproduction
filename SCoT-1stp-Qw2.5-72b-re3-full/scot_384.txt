Input: n: an integer representing the size of the array, arr: a list of integers
Output: frequency: an integer representing the frequency of the smallest value in the array

1: Check if the array is empty or if n is less than 1. If true, return 0 as there are no elements to process.
2: Find the smallest value in the array.
3: Initialize a counter to 0.
4: Loop through each element in the array:
5:     If the current element is equal to the smallest value, increment the counter.
6: Return the counter as the frequency of the smallest value.
