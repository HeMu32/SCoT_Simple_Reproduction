Input: n: an integer representing the number whose odd bits are to be set
Output: The integer with all odd bits set to 1

1: Initialize a variable `mask` to 0. This will be used to create a mask with all odd bits set.
2: Initialize a variable `bit_position` to 1. This will be used to determine the current bit position.
3: Loop while `bit_position` is less than or equal to the number of bits in `n`:
   a: If `bit_position` is odd, set the corresponding bit in `mask` to 1.
   b: Increment `bit_position` by 1.
4: Use bitwise OR operation between `n` and `mask` to set all odd bits in `n`.
5: Return the result of the bitwise OR operation.
