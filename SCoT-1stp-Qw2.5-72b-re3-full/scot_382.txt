Input: A: a circularly sorted array (an array that has been rotated)
Output: count: the number of rotations applied to the original sorted array

1: Initialize count to 0
2: Use a loop to iterate over the array from the first element to the second last element
3:     For each element A[i]:
4:         Check if A[i] is greater than A[i+1]
5:         If true, this indicates the point of rotation
6:             Set count to i + 1
7:             Break the loop
8: If the loop completes without finding a rotation point, the array is not rotated, and count remains 0
9: Return count
