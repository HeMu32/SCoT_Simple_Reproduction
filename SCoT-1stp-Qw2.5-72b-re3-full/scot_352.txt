Input: str: a string
Output: A boolean value indicating whether all characters in the string are unique

1: Initialize an empty set called `seen_chars` to keep track of characters we have encountered.
2: Loop through each character `ch` in the string `str`:
3:     If `ch` is already in `seen_chars`, return False because we found a duplicate.
4:     Otherwise, add `ch` to `seen_chars`.
5: If the loop completes without finding duplicates, return True.
