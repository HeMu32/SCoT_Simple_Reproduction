Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two nested tuples of the same structure, where each element is a tuple
Output: res: a nested tuple with the same structure as the inputs, where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from test_tup1 and test_tup2

1: Define a helper function `add_tuples` that takes two tuples and returns a tuple of their element-wise sum.
2: Use a recursive function `add_nested` to handle the nested structure:
3:     If the current elements are tuples, call `add_tuples` on them.
4:     If the current elements are not tuples, return the sum of the elements.
5: Use the `add_nested` function to process the nested tuples.
6: Return the result.
