Input: A: a list of integers
Output: True if the list is monotonic, False otherwise

1: Initialize two boolean variables, increasing and decreasing, to True.
2: Iterate through the list from the second element to the last element.
3: For each element, compare it with the previous element:
   3.1: If the current element is greater than the previous element, set decreasing to False.
   3.2: If the current element is less than the previous element, set increasing to False.
4: After the loop, if either increasing or decreasing is True, the list is monotonic.
5: Return the logical OR of increasing and decreasing.
