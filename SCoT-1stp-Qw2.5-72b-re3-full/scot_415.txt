Input: arr: a list of integers
Output: A tuple containing the pair of integers from the array that has the highest product

1: Check if the length of the array is less than 2, if so, return None because a pair cannot be formed.
2: Initialize two variables to store the maximum product and the pair of integers that produce this product.
3: Iterate through the array using a loop, for each element, compare it with every other element in the array.
4:     Calculate the product of the current pair of elements.
5:     If the product is greater than the current maximum product, update the maximum product and the pair.
6: After the loop, return the pair of integers that produced the highest product.
