[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: text: a string containing words separated by spaces
Output: result: a list of words that start with 'a' or 'e'

1: Convert the input string into a list of words.
2: Initialize an empty list to store the result.
3: Iterate over each word in the list of words.
4:     For each word, check if it starts with 'a' or 'e'.
5:     If the word starts with 'a' or 'e', add it to the result list.
6: After the loop, return the result list.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def words_ae(text):
  # Split the text into words
  words = text.split()
  # Initialize the result list
  result = []
  # Iterate over each word
  for word in words:
    # Check if the word starts with 'a' or 'e'
    if word.lower().startswith(('a', 'e')):
      # Add the word to the result list
      result.append(word)
  # Return the result list
  return result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** The `split()` method is used to break the input string into a list of words. This method splits the string at each space and returns a list of substrings.
- **Step 2:** An empty list `result` is initialized to store the words that meet the criteria.
- **Step 3:** A `for` loop is used to iterate over each word in the list of words.
- **Step 4:** The `startswith()` method is used to check if the word starts with 'a' or 'e'. The `lower()` method is called on the word to ensure the check is case-insensitive.
- **Step 5:** If the word starts with 'a' or 'e', it is added to the `result` list.
- **Step 6:** After the loop completes, the `result` list is returned, containing all the words that start with 'a' or 'e'.

This function will correctly identify and return all words in the input string that start with the letters 'a' or 'e', regardless of the case.
