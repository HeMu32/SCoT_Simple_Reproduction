[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_list: a list of strings
Output: The word with the most occurrences in the list

1: Initialize an empty dictionary `word_count` to store the count of each word
2: Loop through each string in `test_list`:
3:     Split the string into words
4:     For each word in the split result:
5:         If the word is already in `word_count`, increment its count by 1
6:         Otherwise, add the word to `word_count` with a count of 1
7: Initialize `max_word` to None and `max_count` to 0
8: Loop through each word and its count in `word_count`:
9:     If the count of the current word is greater than `max_count`:
10:        Set `max_word` to the current word and `max_count` to the current count
11: Return `max_word`

### Explanation:
The function `most_occurrences` takes a list of strings as input and returns the word that appears most frequently across all the strings in the list. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Initialize a Dictionary**: A dictionary `word_count` is used to keep track of the frequency of each word.
2. **Loop Through Each String**: For each string in the input list, the string is split into individual words.
3. **Count Words**: For each word, the function checks if it is already in the `word_count` dictionary. If it is, the count is incremented. If it is not, the word is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.
4. **Find the Most Frequent Word**: After counting all the words, the function initializes `max_word` and `max_count` to keep track of the word with the highest frequency. It then iterates through the `word_count` dictionary to find the word with the highest count.
5. **Return the Result**: Finally, the function returns the word with the highest frequency.

This approach ensures that the function efficiently counts the occurrences of each word and identifies the most frequent one.
