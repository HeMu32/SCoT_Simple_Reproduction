Input: str1: a string
Output: A new string with all characters at odd indices removed

1: Initialize an empty string called `result`
2: Loop through the string `str1` using an index `i` starting from 0 to the length of `str1` - 1
3:     If the index `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`), append the character at index `i` to `result`
4: Return the `result` string
