[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: a, b: two angles of a triangle in degrees
Output: The third angle of the triangle in degrees

1: Check if a and b are valid angles (i.e., both are greater than 0 and their sum is less than 180 degrees)
2: If the angles are valid, calculate the third angle by subtracting the sum of a and b from 180 degrees
3: If the angles are not valid, raise an error or return an appropriate message
4: Return the calculated third angle
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def find_angle(a, b):
    # Check if the input angles are valid
    if a <= 0 or b <= 0 or (a + b) >= 180:
        raise ValueError("Angles must be greater than 0 and their sum must be less than 180 degrees.")
    
    # Calculate the third angle
    third_angle = 180 - (a + b)
    
    return third_angle
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `find_angle(a, b)` calculates the third angle of a triangle given two angles `a` and `b`. The process involves:
1. **Validation**: The function first checks if the input angles are valid. Angles must be greater than 0 degrees, and their sum must be less than 180 degrees. If these conditions are not met, a `ValueError` is raised.
2. **Calculation**: If the angles are valid, the third angle is calculated by subtracting the sum of `a` and `b` from 180 degrees.
3. **Return**: The function returns the calculated third angle.

This ensures that the function handles invalid inputs gracefully and provides the correct third angle for valid inputs.
