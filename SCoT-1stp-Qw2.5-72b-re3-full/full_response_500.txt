[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list: a list of elements (can be of any type that can be converted to a string)
Output: result: a single string that is the concatenation of all elements in the list
1: Initialize an empty string called `result`
2: For each element in the list:
3:     Convert the element to a string (if it is not already a string)
4:     Append the string representation of the element to `result`
5: Return `result`
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def concatenate_elements(lst):
    result = ""
    for element in lst:
        result += str(element)
    return result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `concatenate_elements` takes a list of elements as input and returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the elements in the list. The elements can be of any type, but they are converted to strings before concatenation. This is achieved by using a loop to iterate over each element in the list, converting it to a string using the `str()` function, and then appending it to the `result` string. The final concatenated string is returned at the end of the function.
