Input: h_age: an integer representing the human age
Output: d_age: an integer representing the dog's age in dog years

1: If h_age is less than or equal to 2, multiply h_age by 10.5 to get d_age.
2: If h_age is greater than 2, calculate the dog's age as follows:
   - Set d_age to 21 (the equivalent of the first two human years in dog years).
   - Subtract 2 from h_age to get the remaining human years.
   - Multiply the remaining human years by 4 to convert them to dog years.
   - Add the result to d_age.
3: Return d_age.
