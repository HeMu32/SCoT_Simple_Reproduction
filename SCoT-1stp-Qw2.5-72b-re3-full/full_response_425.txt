[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list1: a list of lists (sublists), x: an element to search for
Output: count: the number of sublists containing the element x

1: Initialize count to 0
2: Loop through each sublist in list1
3:     If x is in the current sublist:
4:         Increment count by 1
5: Return count
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def count_element_in_list(list1, x):
    count = 0
    for sublist in list1:
        if x in sublist:
            count += 1
    return count
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `count_element_in_list` is designed to count how many sublists within a given list (`list1`) contain a specific element (`x`). The process involves iterating through each sublist and checking if the element `x` is present. If `x` is found in a sublist, the counter `count` is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total count of sublists that contain the element `x`. This approach ensures that all sublists are checked, and the count is accurate.
