Input: test_list: a list containing elements of various types
Output: result: a list with all convertible elements converted to float

1: Initialize an empty list called result
2: Loop through each element in test_list
3:     Try to convert the element to a float
4:     If the conversion is successful:
5:         Append the converted float to result
6:     If the conversion fails (raises an exception):
7:         Append the original element to result
8: Return the result list
[END PROCESS]

### Explanation:
The function `list_to_float` is designed to iterate over a list and attempt to convert each element to a float. If an element can be successfully converted to a float, the converted value is added to the result list. If an element cannot be converted (e.g., if it is a string that does not represent a number), the original element is added to the result list. This approach ensures that all convertible elements are converted to floats, while non-convertible elements remain unchanged. The function handles potential `ValueError` exceptions that occur when an element cannot be converted to a float.
