[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer representing the position in the sequence of hexagonal numbers
Output: The nth hexagonal number

1: Check if n is less than 1. If so, return an error or an appropriate message, as there are no hexagonal numbers for non-positive integers.
2: Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula: Hn = n * (2n - 1).
3: Return the calculated hexagonal number.
[END PROCESS]

    # Calculate the nth hexagonal number using the formula

Explanation:
The function `hexagonal_num` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth hexagonal number. Hexagonal numbers are a sequence of numbers where each number represents a hexagonal pattern of dots. The formula to calculate the nth hexagonal number is Hn = n * (2n - 1). This formula is derived from the geometric properties of hexagons and the way dots are arranged in a hexagonal pattern. The function first checks if the input `n` is a positive integer, as hexagonal numbers are only defined for positive integers. If `n` is valid, it calculates the hexagonal number using the formula and returns the result. If `n` is not a positive integer, it returns an error message.
