[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_list: a list of tuples, K: an integer indicating the number of elements to trim from each tuple
Output: result: a list of tuples where each tuple has been trimmed by K elements from both the start and the end

1: Initialize an empty list called result to store the trimmed tuples.
2: For each tuple in test_list:
3:     If the length of the tuple is less than 2 * K, skip this tuple as it cannot be trimmed by K from both ends.
4:     Otherwise, slice the tuple from index K to the length of the tuple minus K.
5:     Append the sliced tuple to the result list.
6: Return the result list.
[END PROCESS]

  for tup in test_list:
    if len(tup) > 2 * K:
      trimmed_tup = tup[K:-K]
      result.append(trimmed_tup)
  return result

Explanation:
The function `trim_tuple` takes a list of tuples (`test_list`) and an integer (`K`) as inputs. The goal is to trim `K` elements from the start and the end of each tuple in the list. If a tuple has fewer elements than `2 * K`, it is skipped because it cannot be trimmed by `K` elements from both ends. The function iterates over each tuple, checks its length, and if it is long enough, slices the tuple to remove `K` elements from both the start and the end. The trimmed tuples are then collected in a new list (`result`), which is returned at the end. This approach ensures that only valid tuples (those with a length greater than `2 * K`) are processed and included in the final output.
