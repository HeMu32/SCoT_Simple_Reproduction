Input: r: a float representing the radius of the base of the cone, h: a float representing the height of the cone
Output: volume: a float representing the volume of the cone

1: Define the formula for the volume of a cone, which is (1/3) * Ï€ * r^2 * h
2: Calculate the volume using the given radius and height
3: Return the calculated volume
