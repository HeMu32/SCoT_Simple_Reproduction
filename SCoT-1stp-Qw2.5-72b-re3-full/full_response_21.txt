Input: m: an integer representing the number of multiples to find, n: an integer representing the number to find multiples of
Output: A list of the first m multiples of n

1: Initialize an empty list to store the multiples
2: For i from 1 to m inclusive:
3:     Calculate the multiple by multiplying n by i
4:     Append the multiple to the list
5: Return the list of multiples

### Explanation:
The function `multiples_of_num` is designed to generate the first `m` multiples of a given number `n`. The process involves initializing an empty list to store the multiples, then using a loop to iterate from 1 to `m` (inclusive). In each iteration, the current multiple is calculated by multiplying `n` by the loop index `i`, and this value is appended to the list. Finally, the list of multiples is returned. This approach ensures that the function correctly generates the required multiples and returns them in a list.
