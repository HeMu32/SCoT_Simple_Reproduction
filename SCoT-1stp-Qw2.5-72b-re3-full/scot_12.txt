Input: M: a 2D list (matrix) of integers
Output: M: a 2D list (matrix) of integers sorted in ascending order based on the sum of each row

1: Initialize an empty list to store the sums of each row
2: Loop through each row in the matrix M:
3:     Calculate the sum of the current row
4:     Append the sum to the list of sums
5: Pair each row with its corresponding sum in a list of tuples
6: Sort the list of tuples based on the sum (second element of each tuple)
7: Extract the rows from the sorted list of tuples to form the sorted matrix
8: Return the sorted matrix
