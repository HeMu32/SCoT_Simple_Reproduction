Input: M: an integer representing the length of the sequence
Output: count: the number of sequences of length M with non-negative prefix sums that can be generated by the values -1 and 1

1: Initialize a 2D list dp with dimensions (M+1) x (M+1) to store the number of ways to achieve a certain prefix sum at a certain position in the sequence.
2: Set dp[0][0] to 1, as there is exactly one way to have a prefix sum of 0 with 0 elements.
3: Loop through each position from 1 to M (inclusive) to fill the dp table.
4:     For each possible prefix sum j from 0 to the current position i (inclusive):
5:         If the prefix sum j is greater than 0, add the value of dp[i-1][j-1] to dp[i][j] (this accounts for adding a 1 to the sequence).
6:         If the prefix sum j is less than the current position i, add the value of dp[i-1][j+1] to dp[i][j] (this accounts for adding a -1 to the sequence).
7: The value at dp[M][0] will be the total number of valid sequences of length M.
8: Return dp[M][0] as the result.
