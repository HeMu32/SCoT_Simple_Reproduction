Input: string: a string of characters
Output: A list of characters, where each character in the string is an element in the list

1: Initialize an empty list called `char_list`
2: Loop through each character in the string
3:     Append the current character to `char_list`
4: Return `char_list`

Explanation:
The function `string_to_list` takes a single argument, `string`, which is a string of characters. The goal is to convert this string into a list where each character in the string becomes an individual element in the list.

1. We start by initializing an empty list called `char_list`. This list will store the characters from the string.
2. We then loop through each character in the input string using a for loop. For each character:
   - We append the character to `char_list`.
3. After the loop completes, `char_list` contains all the characters from the string, each as a separate element.
4. Finally, we return `char_list`.

This function effectively converts a string into a list of characters, which can be useful for various string manipulation tasks where individual character access is required.
