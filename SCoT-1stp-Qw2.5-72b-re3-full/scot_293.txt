Input: w, h: two integers representing the two sides of a right-angled triangle (w and h are the legs of the triangle)
Output: res: a float representing the length of the hypotenuse (the third side of the triangle)

1: Import the `math` module to use the square root function.
2: Calculate the square of the hypotenuse using the Pythagorean theorem: `hypotenuse^2 = w^2 + h^2`.
3: Compute the square root of the result from step 2 to get the length of the hypotenuse.
4: Return the length of the hypotenuse as a float.
