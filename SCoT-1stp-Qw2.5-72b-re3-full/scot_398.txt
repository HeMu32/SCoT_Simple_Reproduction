Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: a list of integers where each element is the sum of the digits of the corresponding number in the input list

1: Initialize an empty list to store the sum of digits for each number
2: Loop through each number in the input list
3:   Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit
4:   Initialize a variable to store the sum of digits for the current number
5:   Loop through each character in the string representation of the number
6:     Convert the character back to an integer and add it to the sum of digits
7:   Append the sum of digits to the result list
8: Return the result list
