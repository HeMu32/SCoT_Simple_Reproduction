Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: The first duplicate integer in the list, or None if there are no duplicates

1: Initialize an empty set to keep track of seen numbers
2: Iterate through the list of numbers
3:     For each number, check if it is already in the seen set
4:         If it is, return this number as it is the first duplicate
5:         If it is not, add the number to the seen set
6: If the loop completes without finding a duplicate, return None
