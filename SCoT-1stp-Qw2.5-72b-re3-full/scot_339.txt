Input: x, y: two integers representing the start and end of the interval (inclusive)
Output: max_divisor: the divisor that occurs the most times within the interval [x, y]

1: Initialize a dictionary `divisor_count` to keep track of the occurrence of each divisor.
2: Loop through each number `num` in the range from `x` to `y` inclusive.
3:   For each `num`, loop through all possible divisors `d` from 1 to `num` inclusive.
4:     If `num` is divisible by `d` (i.e., `num % d == 0`), increment the count of `d` in `divisor_count`.
5: Initialize `max_divisor` and `max_count` to store the divisor with the maximum occurrences and its count, respectively.
6: Loop through each key-value pair in `divisor_count`.
7:   If the current count is greater than `max_count`, update `max_divisor` and `max_count`.
8: Return `max_divisor`.
