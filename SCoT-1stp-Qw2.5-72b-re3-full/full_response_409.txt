### Explanation:
The function `min_product_tuple` takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple contains two integers. The goal is to find the minimum product of the pairs of integers from the tuples in the list.

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `min_product` to `None`. This will help us keep track of the minimum product found so far.
2. **Loop through the list**: We iterate over each tuple in the list.
3. **Calculate the product**: For each tuple, we calculate the product of the two integers.
4. **Update the minimum product**: If `min_product` is `None` (which means it hasn't been set yet) or if the current product is less than `min_product`, we update `min_product` to the current product.
5. **Return the result**: After the loop, we return the `min_product`.

This approach ensures that we find the minimum product efficiently by iterating through the list only once, making it an O(n) solution, where n is the number of tuples in the list.
