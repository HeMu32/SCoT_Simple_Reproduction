[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: l: a list, s: a sublist
Output: boolean: True if s is a sublist of l, False otherwise

1: If the length of s is greater than l, return False immediately as s cannot be a sublist of l.
2: Iterate over the list l with an index i from 0 to len(l) - len(s) + 1.
3: For each index i, check if the slice of l from i to i + len(s) is equal to s.
4: If a matching slice is found, return True.
5: If the loop completes without finding a match, return False.

Explanation:
The function `is_sublist` checks if a given sublist `s` is contained within a larger list `l`. The function first checks if the length of `s` is greater than `l`, in which case it immediately returns False because a longer list cannot be a sublist of a shorter one. The function then iterates over the list `l` using a loop, where the index `i` ranges from 0 to the length of `l` minus the length of `s` plus one. This ensures that the slice of `l` from `i` to `i + len(s)` does not exceed the bounds of `l`. For each index `i`, the function checks if the slice of `l` from `i` to `i + len(s)` is equal to `s`. If a match is found, the function returns True. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns False, indicating that `s` is not a sublist of `l`.
