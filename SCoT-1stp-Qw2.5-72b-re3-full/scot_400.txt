Input: test_list: a list of tuples
Output: freq_dict: a dictionary where each key is a tuple (considering order of elements as irrelevant) and the value is the frequency of that tuple in the input list

1: Import Counter from the collections module
2: Initialize an empty Counter object named freq_dict
3: For each tuple t in test_list:
4:     Sort the tuple t to ensure that tuples with the same elements in different orders are treated as the same
5:     Convert the sorted tuple to a tuple (since lists are not hashable and cannot be used as dictionary keys)
6:     Update the Counter object with the sorted tuple
7: Return the freq_dict
