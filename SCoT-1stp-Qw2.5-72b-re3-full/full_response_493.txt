Input: startx, starty, endx, endy, radius: numerical values representing the starting and ending coordinates of the grid and the radius of the hexagons.
Output: A list of lists, where each inner list contains 6 tuples representing the coordinates of the vertices of a hexagon.

1: Import the math module to use trigonometric functions.
2: Define the function `calculate_polygons` with parameters `startx`, `starty`, `endx`, `endy`, and `radius`.
3: Calculate the horizontal and vertical distances between the start and end points to determine the grid size.
4: Calculate the side length of the hexagon using the radius.
5: Initialize an empty list to store the hexagon coordinates.
6: Loop through the grid, starting from `startx` and `starty` to `endx` and `endy` with steps based on the hexagon's dimensions.
7:   For each position, calculate the coordinates of the hexagon's vertices.
8:   Append the list of vertices to the hexagon coordinates list.
9: Return the list of hexagon coordinates.

Explanation:
- The function will generate a grid of hexagons within the specified bounds.
- The vertices of each hexagon are calculated using trigonometric functions, considering the hexagon's radius and the center point.
- The step size for the grid is determined by the hexagon's dimensions to ensure that the hexagons fit perfectly without gaps or overlaps.

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Importing the Math Module**: The `math` module is imported to use trigonometric functions and the square root function.
2. **Side Length Calculation**: The side length of the hexagon is calculated using the formula `side_length = radius * sqrt(3)`.
3. **Step Size Calculation**: The horizontal and vertical step sizes are calculated to ensure that the hexagons fit perfectly within the grid. The horizontal step is `1.5 * side_length`, and the vertical step is `sqrt(3) * radius`.
4. **Hexagon Coordinates Calculation**: For each position in the grid, the coordinates of the hexagon's vertices are calculated using trigonometric relationships. The hexagon is centered at `(x, y)`, and the vertices are calculated by moving in specific directions from the center.
5. **Appending Hexagons**: Each hexagon's vertices are stored in a list and appended to the main list of hexagons.
6. **Returning the Result**: The function returns the list of hexagons, where each hexagon is represented as a list of 6 tuples, each tuple containing the coordinates of a vertex.

This function will generate a grid of hexagons within the specified bounds, with each hexagon's vertices accurately calculated based on the given radius.
