Input: list1: a list of lists
Output: a list of lists with the maximum length

1: Initialize a variable max_len to 0 to keep track of the maximum length found.
2: Initialize an empty list max_lists to store lists that have the maximum length.
3: Loop through each sublist in list1:
4:     If the length of the current sublist is greater than max_len:
5:         Update max_len to the length of the current sublist.
6:         Clear max_lists and add the current sublist to max_lists.
7:     Else if the length of the current sublist is equal to max_len:
8:         Add the current sublist to max_lists.
9: Return max_lists.
