Input: list1: a list of integers
Output: res: the result of dividing the first even number by the first odd number in the list

1: Initialize variables `first_even` and `first_odd` to `None`.
2: Iterate through the list `list1`:
3:     For each element, check if it is even:
4:         If it is even and `first_even` is `None`, set `first_even` to the current element.
5:     Otherwise, check if it is odd:
6:         If it is odd and `first_odd` is `None`, set `first_odd` to the current element.
7:     If both `first_even` and `first_odd` are not `None`, break the loop.
8: If `first_even` or `first_odd` is `None`, return a message indicating that the division cannot be performed.
9: Otherwise, compute the division of `first_even` by `first_odd`.
10: Return the result of the division.

### Explanation:
The function `div_even_odd` is designed to find the first even and the first odd number in the given list `list1` and return their division. The function iterates through the list, checking each number to determine if it is even or odd. It keeps track of the first even and the first odd numbers it encounters. If both an even and an odd number are found, it performs the division and returns the result. If either an even or an odd number is missing, it returns a message indicating that the division cannot be performed. This approach ensures that the function handles cases where the list might not contain both an even and an odd number.
