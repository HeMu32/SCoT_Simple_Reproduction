Input: n: the row number, k: the position in the row
Output: The Entringer number E(n, k)

1: If n or k is less than 0, return 0 (base case for invalid input).
2: If n or k is 0, return 1 (base case for the first row and column).
3: Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
4: For each index `i` from 0 to `k`:
5:     Recursively calculate the Entringer number for the previous row and the current column, and the current row and the previous column.
6:     Add the result of the recursive call to `result`.
7: Return `result`.
