[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: A: a list of integers, N: the length of the list A
Output: count: the number of pairs (i, j) such that A[i] XOR A[j] is an even number and i < j

1: Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the number of valid pairs.
2: Loop through each element in the list A using index i.
3: For each element A[i], loop through the elements that come after it in the list using index j (i.e., j > i).
4: Compute the XOR of A[i] and A[j].
5: Check if the result of the XOR operation is even.
6: If the result is even, increment the count by 1.
7: After all pairs have been checked, return the count.
[END PROCESS]

Explanation:
The function `find_even_Pair` takes a list `A` and its length `N` as inputs. It counts the number of pairs (i, j) in the list such that the XOR of A[i] and A[j] is an even number, and i < j. The XOR of two numbers is even if and only if both numbers are either even or both are odd. This is because the XOR of two even numbers or two odd numbers results in an even number, while the XOR of an even number and an odd number results in an odd number. The function uses nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of elements in the list and checks if the XOR of each pair is even. If it is, the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total count of such pairs.
