[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: data: a list of numbers
Output: Boolean value indicating whether all numbers in the list are distinct

1: Convert the list `data` to a set to remove duplicates
2: Compare the length of the original list `data` with the length of the set
3: If the lengths are the same, all numbers are distinct, return True
4: If the lengths are different, there are duplicates, return False
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def test_distinct(data):
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_data = set(data)
    
    # Compare the lengths
    if len(data) == len(unique_data):
        return True
    else:
        return False
[END CODE]

**Explanation:**
The function `test_distinct` checks if all elements in the input list `data` are distinct. It does this by converting the list to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements. By comparing the length of the original list with the length of the set, we can determine if there were any duplicates. If the lengths are the same, it means all elements were unique, and the function returns `True`. If the lengths differ, it means there were duplicates, and the function returns `False`. This method is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the properties of sets in Python.
