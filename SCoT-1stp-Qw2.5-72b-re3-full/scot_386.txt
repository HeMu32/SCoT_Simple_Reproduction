Input: s: a string consisting of brackets, e.g., "[]", "][", "[][]", etc.
Output: an integer representing the minimum number of swaps required to balance the brackets in the string.

1: Initialize two counters: `open_brackets` to count the number of open brackets and `swaps` to count the number of swaps needed.
2: Iterate through each character in the string `s`:
3:     If the character is an opening bracket '[':
4:         Increment `open_brackets` by 1.
5:     If the character is a closing bracket ']':
6:         If `open_brackets` is greater than 0, it means there is an unmatched opening bracket that can be matched with this closing bracket:
7:             Decrement `open_brackets` by 1.
8:         Otherwise, it means there is no unmatched opening bracket to match this closing bracket, so a swap is needed:
9:             Increment `swaps` by 1.
10: After the loop, if `open_brackets` is not 0, it means there are unmatched opening brackets left, which will require additional swaps to balance:
11:     Increment `swaps` by `open_brackets` // 2 (since each pair of unmatched opening brackets can be balanced with one swap).
12: Return the total number of swaps.
