Input: S: a list of elements, step: an integer indicating the step size
Output: result: a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list, starting from the first element and then every nth element

1: Initialize an empty list called result to store the sublists
2: For each index i from 0 to step-1 (inclusive):
3:     Initialize an empty list called temp to store the elements for the current sublist
4:     For each index j from i to the length of S, incrementing by step:
5:         Append S[j] to temp
6:     Append temp to result
7: Return result

### Explanation

The function `list_split` takes two parameters: `S`, which is the list to be split, and `step`, which is the step size indicating how often to pick the next element. The function returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list, starting from the first element and then every nth element.

1. **Initialization**: An empty list `result` is initialized to store the final sublists.
2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over the range from 0 to `step-1`. This loop is responsible for starting the sublists at different initial positions.
3. **Inner Loop**: For each starting position `i`, an inner loop is used to collect elements from the original list `S`. The inner loop starts at `i` and increments by `step` to ensure that it picks every nth element.
4. **Appending Elements**: The elements collected in the inner loop are appended to a temporary list `temp`.
5. **Appending Sublists**: After the inner loop completes, the temporary list `temp` is appended to the `result` list.
6. **Return Result**: Finally, the `result` list, which contains all the sublists, is returned.

This approach ensures that the list is split into sublists where each sublist contains elements starting from a different initial position and then every nth element.
