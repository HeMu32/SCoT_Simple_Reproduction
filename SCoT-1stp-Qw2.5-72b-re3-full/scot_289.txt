Input: N: an integer representing the year
Output: The number of odd days in the given year

1: Initialize `odd_days` to 0
2: Determine if the year is a leap year:
   - A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400.
3: If the year is a leap year, set `days_in_year` to 366, otherwise set `days_in_year` to 365
4: Calculate the number of odd days by taking the remainder of `days_in_year` divided by 7
5: Return `odd_days`
