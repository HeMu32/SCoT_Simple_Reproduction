[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: monthnum2: an integer representing a month number (1-12)
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the month has 31 days or not

1: Create a list of months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December)
2: Check if the given month number is in the list of months with 31 days
3: If the month number is in the list, return True
4: Otherwise, return False
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def check_monthnumb_number(monthnum2):
    # List of months with 31 days
    months_with_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    
    # Check if the given month number is in the list
    if monthnum2 in months_with_31_days:
        return True
    else:
        return False
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `check_monthnumb_number` takes an integer `monthnum2` as input, which represents a month number (1 for January, 2 for February, etc.). The function checks whether the given month number corresponds to a month that has 31 days. 

- A list `months_with_31_days` is defined, containing the month numbers of months that have 31 days.
- The function then checks if `monthnum2` is in this list.
- If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days.
- If it is not, the function returns `False`, indicating that the month does not have 31 days.

This approach is straightforward and leverages a simple list lookup to determine the result.
