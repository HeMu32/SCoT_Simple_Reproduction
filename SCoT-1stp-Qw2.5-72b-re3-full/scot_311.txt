Input: n: an integer
Output: result: an integer with the leftmost unset bit set

1: Convert the integer `n` to its binary representation.
2: Identify the position of the leftmost unset bit (0) in the binary representation.
3: If no unset bit is found (i.e., all bits are 1), return `n` as it is.
4: Otherwise, create a mask with a single bit set at the position of the identified unset bit.
5: Apply the OR operation between `n` and the mask to set the identified bit.
6: Return the result of the OR operation.
