### Explanation:
The function `distance_lat_long` calculates the distance between two points on the Earth's surface given their latitude and longitude. The Haversine formula is used to calculate the great-circle distance, which is the shortest distance over the Earth's surface, giving an "as-the-crow-flies" distance between the points (ignoring any hills, valleys, etc.).

1. **Conversion to Radians**: The input latitudes and longitudes are in degrees, but the trigonometric functions in Python's `math` module require angles in radians. Therefore, the first step is to convert these values to radians.

2. **Haversine Formula**: The Haversine formula is used to calculate the great-circle distance between two points. The formula involves the differences in latitude and longitude, and the cosine and sine functions.

3. **Distance Calculation**: The final distance is calculated by multiplying the Earth's radius by the central angle (in radians) obtained from the Haversine formula.

This function is useful in various applications, such as GPS navigation, mapping, and geographic information systems (GIS).
