Input: arr: a list of integers, N: the length of the list, P: a prime number
Output: count of elements in arr whose modular inverse under P is equal to itself

1: Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of elements that meet the condition
2: Loop through each element `x` in the array `arr`
3:     Calculate the modular inverse of `x` under `P` using the formula `x^(P-2) % P` (Fermat's Little Theorem)
4:     If the modular inverse of `x` is equal to `x` itself:
5:         Increment `count` by 1
6: Return the value of `count`
