Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the array
Output: A list where all negative elements appear before positive ones

1: Initialize two empty lists: `negatives` and `positives`.
2: Iterate through each element in `arr`:
3:     If the element is less than 0 (negative):
4:         Append the element to `negatives`.
5:     Else:
6:         Append the element to `positives`.
7: Concatenate `negatives` and `positives` to form the final rearranged array.
8: Return the rearranged array.
