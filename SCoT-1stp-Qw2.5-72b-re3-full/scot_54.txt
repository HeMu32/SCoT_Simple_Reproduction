Input: my_list: a list of non-negative integers
Output: sorted_list: a list of integers sorted in ascending order

1: Find the maximum value in the list to determine the size of the count array
2: Initialize a count array with zeros, with a length equal to the maximum value + 1
3: Count the occurrences of each value in the input list and store the counts in the count array
4: Modify the count array such that each element at each index stores the sum of previous counts
5: Initialize an output array of the same length as the input list
6: Traverse the input list in reverse to maintain the stability of the sort
7: For each element in the input list:
8:     Use the count array to determine the position of the element in the output array
9:     Place the element in the output array
10:    Decrease the count of the element in the count array
11: Return the output array as the sorted list
