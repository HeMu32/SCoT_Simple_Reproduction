[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: arr: a list of integers, lens: the length of the list, n: an integer divisor
Output: The remainder of the product of all elements in arr divided by n

1: Initialize a variable `product` to 1. This variable will hold the cumulative product of the elements in the array.
2: Loop through each element in the array `arr`.
3: For each element, multiply it with `product` and take the modulo `n` of the result to avoid large number overflow.
4: After the loop, return the value of `product` which now holds the remainder of the product of all elements divided by `n`.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def find_remainder(arr, lens, n):
    product = 1
    for i in range(lens):
        product = (product * (arr[i] % n)) % n
    return product
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `find_remainder` calculates the remainder of the product of all elements in the array `arr` when divided by `n`. To handle large numbers and prevent overflow, the product is taken modulo `n` at each step of the multiplication. This ensures that the intermediate results remain manageable and the final result is accurate. The function iterates over the array using a for loop, multiplying each element by the current product and taking the modulo `n` of the result. After the loop completes, the final value of `product` is returned, which is the remainder of the product of all elements in the array divided by `n`.
