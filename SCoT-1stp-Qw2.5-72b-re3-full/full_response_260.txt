The Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) primes are a sequence of prime numbers that can be generated using a specific recurrence relation. The nth NSW prime is defined as a prime number that appears in the sequence generated by the following recurrence relation:

- \( S_0 = 1 \)
- \( S_1 = 1 \)
- \( S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \)

The sequence \( S_n \) is known as the NSW sequence. The NSW primes are the prime numbers that appear in this sequence.

### Task:
Write a function `newman_prime(n)` that returns the nth NSW prime number.

### Solving Process:
[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer representing the position of the NSW prime to find
Output: the nth NSW prime number

1: Initialize the first two terms of the NSW sequence: \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \)
2: Initialize a list to store the NSW primes found
3: Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of NSW primes found
4: Use a loop to generate terms of the NSW sequence until the nth NSW prime is found
5:   For each term \( S_n \) in the sequence:
6:     Check if \( S_n \) is a prime number
7:     If \( S_n \) is prime:
8:       Add \( S_n \) to the list of NSW primes
9:       Increment the counter
10:      If the counter equals n:
11:        Return the nth NSW prime
12:   Generate the next term \( S_{n+1} \) using the recurrence relation
[END PROCESS]

### Code Implementation:
[BEGIN CODE]
def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def newman_prime(n):
    """Find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number."""
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    nsw_primes = []
    counter = 0
    
    while counter < n:
        # Generate the next term in the sequence
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        
        # Check if the term is a prime number
        if is_prime(S_next):
            nsw_primes.append(S_next)
            counter += 1
        
        # Update the sequence terms
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
    
    return nsw_primes[-1]

# Example usage:
print(newman_prime(1))  # Output: 2
print(newman_prime(2))  # Output: 7
print(newman_prime(3))  # Output: 41
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
1. **Prime Check Function**: The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime using a simple and efficient algorithm.
2. **NSW Sequence Generation**: The `newman_prime` function generates the NSW sequence using the recurrence relation \( S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \).
3. **Prime Collection**: The function keeps track of the NSW primes found and returns the nth prime when the counter reaches n.
4. **Efficiency**: The function is designed to efficiently generate the sequence and check for primes, ensuring that it can handle larger values of n.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies and returns the nth NSW prime number.
