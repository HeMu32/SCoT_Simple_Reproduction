Input: a, b, n: integers
Output: A tuple (x, y) of integers that satisfy the equation ax + by = n, or None if no such integers exist

1: Initialize x to 0
2: Loop through possible values of x from 0 to n/a (inclusive):
3:     Calculate y as (n - ax) / b
4:     Check if y is an integer:
5:         If y is an integer, return (x, y)
6: If no solution is found, return None
