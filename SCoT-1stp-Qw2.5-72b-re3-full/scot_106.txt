Input: test_list: a list of elements, test_tup: a tuple of elements
Output: res: a new list where each element from the list is added to the corresponding element in the tuple

1: Initialize an empty list `res` to store the result.
2: Determine the length of the shorter of the two input sequences (list or tuple) to avoid index out-of-range errors.
3: Loop through the range of the determined length:
4:     For each index `i`, add the `i`th element of `test_list` to the `i`th element of `test_tup`.
5:     Append the result of the addition to `res`.
6: If the list `test_list` is longer than `test_tup`:
7:     Append the remaining elements of `test_list` to `res`.
8: If the tuple `test_tup` is longer than `test_list`:
9:     Convert the remaining part of `test_tup` to a list and append these elements to `res`.
10: Return the list `res`.
