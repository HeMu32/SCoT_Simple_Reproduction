[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer representing the number of the first natural numbers to consider.
Output: The difference between the squared sum of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.

1: Initialize a variable `sum_of_squares` to 0 to store the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.
2: Initialize a variable `square_of_sum` to 0 to store the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers.
3: Loop from 1 to n (inclusive):
4:     Add the square of the current number to `sum_of_squares`.
5:     Add the current number to `square_of_sum`.
6: After the loop, square the `square_of_sum`.
7: Calculate the difference between `square_of_sum` and `sum_of_squares`.
8: Return the calculated difference.

### Explanation:
The function `sum_difference` calculates the difference between two values:
- The square of the sum of the first n natural numbers.
- The sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.

The process involves:
1. Initializing two variables to store the sum of squares and the sum of the numbers.
2. Iterating through the first n natural numbers, updating the sum of squares and the sum of the numbers.
3. Squaring the sum of the numbers to get the square of the sum.
4. Calculating the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares.
5. Returning the difference.

This approach ensures that the function correctly computes the required difference for any given positive integer n.
