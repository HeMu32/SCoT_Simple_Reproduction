Input: a: a list of integers, n: an integer representing the step count for removal, m: an integer representing the initial position (0-based index)
Output: pos: an integer representing the position of the last removed element (0-based index)

1: Initialize a variable `pos` to `m` to keep track of the current position.
2: Initialize a variable `count` to the length of the list `a`.
3: While the list `a` has more than one element:
   4: Calculate the next position to remove using the formula `(pos + n - 1) % count`.
   5: Remove the element at the calculated position from the list `a`.
   6: Update `pos` to the new position.
   7: Decrease `count` by 1.
8: The last remaining element in the list `a` is the last removed element.
9: Return the position of the last removed element, which is the index of the last element in the original list.
