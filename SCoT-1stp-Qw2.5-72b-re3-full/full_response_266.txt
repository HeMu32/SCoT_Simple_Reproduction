Input: l: the length of a side of the cube
Output:lsa: the lateral surface area of the cube

1: Calculate the lateral surface area (lsa) of the cube using the formula 4 * l * l, where l is the length of a side of the cube.
2: Return the calculated lateral surface area.
[END PROCESS]

Explanation:
The lateral surface area of a cube is the area of the four side faces, excluding the top and bottom faces. Since a cube has all sides of equal length, the area of one side face is l * l, where l is the length of a side. There are four such faces, so the formula for the lateral surface area is 4 * l * l. The function `lateralsurface_cube` takes the length of a side of the cube as input and returns the lateral surface area calculated using this formula.
