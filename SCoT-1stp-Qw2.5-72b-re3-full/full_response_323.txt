[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: arr: a list of integers, n: an integer representing the length of the list
Output: a list of integers rearranged such that positive and negative numbers alternate, starting with a positive number if possible
1: Initialize two lists, pos and neg, to store positive and negative numbers from arr, respectively
2: Iterate through the elements in arr
3:     If the element is positive, append it to pos
4:     If the element is negative, append it to neg
5: Initialize an empty list, result, to store the rearranged elements
6: Initialize two index variables, i and j, to 0 for tracking the current position in pos and neg lists, respectively
7: While i is less than the length of pos and j is less than the length of neg:
8:     Append the element at index i from pos to result
9:     Increment i by 1
10:     Append the element at index j from neg to result
11:     Increment j by 1
12: If there are remaining elements in pos, append them to result
13: If there are remaining elements in neg, append them to result
14: Return result

### Explanation:
The function `re_arrange` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as input and rearranges the array such that positive and negative numbers alternate. The process involves:
1. Separating the positive and negative numbers into two different lists.
2. Iterating through these lists and appending elements alternately to the result list.
3. If one list is exhausted before the other, the remaining elements of the non-exhausted list are appended to the result list.
4. The function returns the rearranged list.

This approach ensures that the array is rearranged to have alternating positive and negative numbers, starting with a positive number if possible. If there are more positive or negative numbers, the extra numbers are appended at the end.
