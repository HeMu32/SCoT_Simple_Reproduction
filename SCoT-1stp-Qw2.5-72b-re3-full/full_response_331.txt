[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer
Output: count: the number of unset (0) bits in the binary representation of n

1: Convert the integer n to its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix.
2: Initialize a counter variable count to 0.
3: Loop through each character in the binary string:
4:     If the character is '0':
5:         Increment the count by 1.
6: Return the count.
[END PROCESS]

### Explanation:
The function `count_unset_bits` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the number of unset bits (bits that are 0) in its binary representation. The process involves converting the integer to its binary form, iterating through each bit, and counting the number of '0's. The binary representation is obtained using Python's built-in `bin()` function, which returns a string prefixed with '0b'. The `[2:]` slice is used to remove this prefix, leaving only the binary digits. The loop then checks each bit, and if it is '0', the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the total count of unset bits.
