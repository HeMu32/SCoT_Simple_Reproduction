Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: result: a list of integers where each element is the sum of consecutive numbers from the input list

1: Initialize an empty list result
2: For each index i in the range from 0 to the length of nums - 1:
3:     If i is less than the length of nums - 1 (to ensure there is a next element):
4:         Add nums[i] and nums[i+1] and append the sum to result
5: Return result
