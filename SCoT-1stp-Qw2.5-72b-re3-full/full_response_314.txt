Input: A 2D list (grid) of integers, where the grid is of dimension 2 x n.
Output: The maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the grid.

1: Initialize two variables, `prev` and `curr`, to store the maximum sums of the previous and current columns, respectively.
2: Iterate through each column of the grid.
3:     For each column, calculate the maximum sum of the current column's elements, considering the non-adjacency rule.
4:     Update `curr` with the maximum of the current column's sum plus `prev` (the sum from two columns back) and `prev` itself (if skipping the current column gives a better sum).
5:     Update `prev` to the old `curr` value before updating `curr`.
6: After the loop, return `curr` as the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements.

### Explanation:
- The function `max_sum_rectangular_grid` takes a 2D list `grid` as input, where each row represents a row in the grid and each column represents a column in the grid.
- The function initializes `prev` and `curr` to 0. These variables keep track of the maximum sums of the previous and current columns, respectively.
- The function iterates through each column of the grid. For each column, it calculates the maximum sum of the current column's elements, considering the non-adjacency rule. This is done by taking the maximum of:
  - The sum of the current column's elements plus the sum from two columns back (`prev`).
  - The sum from the previous column (`curr`), which means skipping the current column.
- The `prev` variable is updated to the old `curr` value before updating `curr` to the new maximum sum.
- After the loop, the function returns `curr`, which contains the maximum sum of non-adjacent elements in the grid.

This approach ensures that no two chosen numbers are adjacent, and it efficiently computes the maximum sum using dynamic programming.
