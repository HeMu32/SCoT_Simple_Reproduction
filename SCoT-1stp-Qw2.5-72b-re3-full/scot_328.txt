Input: list1: a list of elements; m: the number of positions to rotate the list to the left; n: the length of the list
Output: A new list with elements rotated m positions to the left

1: Validate the input to ensure m is within the bounds of the list length (0 <= m < n).
2: If m is 0 or the list is empty, return the list as is since no rotation is needed.
3: If m is greater than or equal to the length of the list, reduce m by the length of the list to find the effective rotation (m % n).
4: Split the list into two parts: the first m elements and the rest of the list.
5: Concatenate the second part of the list with the first part to achieve the left rotation.
6: Return the concatenated list.
