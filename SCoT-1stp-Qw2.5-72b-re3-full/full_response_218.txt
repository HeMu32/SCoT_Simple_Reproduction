[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: A, B: two integers
Output: operations: the minimum number of operations required to make A and B equal

1: Initialize the variable `operations` to 0 to count the number of operations.
2: While A and B are not equal:
3:     If A is greater than B:
4:         Increment B by 1 (B = B + 1)
5:     Else if B is greater than A:
6:         Increment A by 1 (A = A + 1)
7:     Increment the `operations` counter by 1.
8: Return the `operations` counter.
[END PROCESS]

### Explanation:
The function `min_Operations` is designed to find the minimum number of operations required to make two integers, `A` and `B`, equal. The operations allowed are incrementing either `A` or `B` by 1. The process is straightforward:

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a counter `operations` to 0. This counter will keep track of the number of operations performed.
2. **Loop**: We use a `while` loop to continue the process as long as `A` and `B` are not equal.
3. **Branching**: Inside the loop, we check which of the two numbers is larger:
   - If `A` is greater than `B`, we increment `B` by 1.
   - If `B` is greater than `A`, we increment `A` by 1.
4. **Increment Operations Counter**: After each operation, we increment the `operations` counter by 1.
5. **Return Result**: Once `A` and `B` are equal, the loop exits, and we return the `operations` counter, which represents the minimum number of operations required to make `A` and `B` equal.

This approach ensures that we always move the smaller number closer to the larger number in each step, minimizing the total number of operations needed.
