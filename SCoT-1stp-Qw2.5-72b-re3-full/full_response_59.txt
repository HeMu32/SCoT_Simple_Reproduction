### Explanation:
The function `is_octagonal(n)` is designed to compute the nth octagonal number. An octagonal number is a figurate number that represents an octagon. The formula to find the nth octagonal number is given by \( O_n = n(3n - 2) \). This formula is derived from the geometric properties of an octagon and can be used to directly compute the desired number without the need for iterative or recursive processes. The function takes an integer `n` as input, applies the formula, and returns the result. This approach ensures that the function is efficient and straightforward.
