Input: test_list: a list of strings
Output: The word with the most occurrences in the list

1: Initialize an empty dictionary `word_count` to store the count of each word
2: Loop through each string in `test_list`:
3:     Split the string into words
4:     For each word in the split result:
5:         If the word is already in `word_count`, increment its count by 1
6:         Otherwise, add the word to `word_count` with a count of 1
7: Initialize `max_word` to None and `max_count` to 0
8: Loop through each word and its count in `word_count`:
9:     If the count of the current word is greater than `max_count`:
10:        Set `max_word` to the current word and `max_count` to the current count
11: Return `max_word`
