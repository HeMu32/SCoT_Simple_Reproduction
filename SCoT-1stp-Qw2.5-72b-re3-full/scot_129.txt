Input: my_matrix: a 2D list of integers representing a square matrix
Output: True if the matrix is a magic square, False otherwise

1: Initialize a variable `n` to the length of the matrix (number of rows or columns, since it's a square matrix)
2: Calculate the sum of the first row to use as a reference sum for all rows, columns, and diagonals
3: Check if all rows have the same sum as the reference sum
4: Check if all columns have the same sum as the reference sum
5: Check if the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) has the same sum as the reference sum
6: Check if the secondary diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) has the same sum as the reference sum
7: If all checks pass, return True; otherwise, return False
