Input: n: an integer representing the number of first natural numbers to consider
Output: The average of the cubes of the first n natural numbers

1: Initialize a variable `sum_of_cubes` to 0 to store the sum of cubes
2: Loop from 1 to n (inclusive)
3:     For each number i in the loop, calculate i^3 and add it to `sum_of_cubes`
4: After the loop, calculate the average by dividing `sum_of_cubes` by n
5: Return the calculated average
