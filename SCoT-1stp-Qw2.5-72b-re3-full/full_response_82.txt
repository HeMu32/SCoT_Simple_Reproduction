Input: r: a float representing the radius of the sphere
Output: volume: a float representing the volume of the sphere

1: Define the mathematical constant pi (π) as 3.14159.
2: Calculate the volume of the sphere using the formula \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \).
3: Return the calculated volume.

Explanation:
The function `volume_sphere` takes a single argument `r`, which is the radius of the sphere. The volume of a sphere is calculated using the formula \( V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \). In this implementation, the value of π is approximated as 3.14159. The function computes the volume by substituting the radius into the formula and returns the result. This function does not require any branches or loops, as the calculation is straightforward and can be done in a single sequence of operations.
