Input: test_tup: a tuple containing elements that can be concatenated (e.g., strings, numbers, etc.)
Output: result: a new tuple where each element is the concatenation of adjacent elements from the input tuple

1: Initialize an empty list `result` to store the concatenated elements.
2: Iterate over the elements of `test_tup` using a loop, but stop one element before the end to avoid index out of range errors.
3: For each element, concatenate it with the next element in the tuple and append the result to the `result` list.
4: Convert the `result` list back into a tuple.
5: Return the `result` tuple.
