Input: m, n: integers representing the dimensions of a rectangle.
Output: count: the number of squares that can be formed within the rectangle.

1: Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of squares.
2: Determine the smaller dimension between `m` and `n` and store it in `min_dim`.
3: Loop from `1` to `min_dim` (inclusive) to consider squares of all possible sizes.
4: For each square size `i`:
5:     Calculate the number of squares of size `i` that can fit horizontally in the rectangle, which is `m - i + 1`.
6:     Calculate the number of squares of size `i` that can fit vertically in the rectangle, which is `n - i + 1`.
7:     Multiply the horizontal and vertical counts to get the total number of squares of size `i` that can fit in the rectangle.
8:     Add this total to `count`.
9: Return `count`.
