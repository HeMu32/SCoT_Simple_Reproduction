2: For each character (char) in str1:
3:     If char is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
4:     If char is already in the dictionary, increment its count by 1
5: Initialize max_char to None and max_count to 0
6: For each key (char) and value (count) in the dictionary:
7:     If count is greater than max_count:
8:         Set max_char to char and max_count to count
9: Return max_char
