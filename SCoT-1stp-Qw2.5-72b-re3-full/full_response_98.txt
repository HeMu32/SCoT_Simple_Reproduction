[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: numbers: a list of numbers
Output: result: a single number which is the product of all numbers in the list divided by the length of the list

1: Initialize a variable `product` to 1, which will hold the result of multiplying all numbers in the list.
2: Initialize a variable `length` to the length of the list `numbers`.
3: If the list `numbers` is empty:
4:     Return 0, as there are no numbers to multiply.
5: Else:
6:     For each number in the list `numbers`:
7:         Multiply `product` by the current number.
8:     Divide `product` by `length` to get the final result.
9: Return the final result.

### Explanation:
The function `multiply_num` takes a list of numbers as input. It first initializes a variable `product` to 1, which will be used to store the product of all the numbers in the list. It also initializes a variable `length` to the length of the list.

The function then checks if the list is empty. If it is, the function returns 0 immediately, as there are no numbers to multiply. If the list is not empty, the function iterates over each number in the list, multiplying `product` by the current number in each iteration.

After the loop, the function divides `product` by the length of the list to get the final result, which is then returned. This approach ensures that the function correctly handles both empty and non-empty lists.
