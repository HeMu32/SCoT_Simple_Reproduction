[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: str1: a string
Output: A new string with all characters at odd indices removed

1: Initialize an empty string called `result`
2: Loop through the string `str1` using an index `i` starting from 0 to the length of `str1` - 1
3:     If the index `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`), append the character at index `i` to `result`
4: Return the `result` string
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def remove_odd(str1):
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(str1)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += str1[i]
    return result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `remove_odd` is designed to remove characters at odd indices from the input string `str1`. In Python, string indices start at 0, so even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) correspond to the "odd" positions in a 1-based index system. The function iterates over each character in the string using a for loop, and it checks if the current index is even. If it is, the character at that index is appended to the `result` string. Finally, the function returns the `result` string, which contains only the characters at even indices from the original string.
