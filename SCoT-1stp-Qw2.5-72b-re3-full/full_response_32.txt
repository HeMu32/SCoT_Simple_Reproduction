### Explanation:
The function `max_Prime_Factors(n)` is designed to find the largest prime factor of a given integer `n`. The process involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `largest_prime` to -1. This is a placeholder value to handle edge cases where `n` might be 1 or no prime factors are found.

2. **Handling Even Numbers**: We first check if `n` is even (i.e., divisible by 2). If it is, we repeatedly divide `n` by 2 and set `largest_prime` to 2. This step ensures that we remove all factors of 2 from `n`.

3. **Checking Odd Factors**: After handling the even factors, we move on to checking for odd factors. We iterate from 3 to the square root of `n`, incrementing by 2 (to check only odd numbers). For each odd number `i`, we check if it divides `n`. If it does, we repeatedly divide `n` by `i` and set `largest_prime` to `i`.

4. **Final Check for Prime**: After the loop, if `n` is still greater than 2, it means `n` itself is a prime number and is the largest prime factor. We set `largest_prime` to `n`.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return `largest_prime`, which is the largest prime factor of the original number `n`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the largest prime factor by first removing all factors of 2 and then checking for odd factors up to the square root of `n`. This reduces the number of iterations and makes the function more efficient.
