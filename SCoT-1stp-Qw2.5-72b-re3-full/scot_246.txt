Input: number: a positive number for which the square root is to be calculated
Output: the square root of the input number using the Babylonian method

1: Check if the input number is non-negative.
2: If the number is less than or equal to 0, return 0 as the square root.
3: Initialize a guess for the square root, typically starting with the number itself or 1.
4: Set a tolerance level to determine when to stop the iteration (e.g., 1e-7).
5: Use a loop to iteratively improve the guess:
   5.1: Calculate a new guess using the formula: new_guess = (guess + number / guess) / 2
   5.2: Check if the difference between the new guess and the old guess is less than the tolerance.
   5.3: If the difference is less than the tolerance, the new guess is close enough to the actual square root, so break the loop.
   5.4: Otherwise, set the old guess to the new guess and continue the loop.
6: Return the new guess as the square root of the number.
