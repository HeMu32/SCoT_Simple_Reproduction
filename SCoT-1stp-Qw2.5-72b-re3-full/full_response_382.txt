[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: A: a circularly sorted array (an array that has been rotated)
Output: count: the number of rotations applied to the original sorted array

1: Initialize count to 0
2: Use a loop to iterate over the array from the first element to the second last element
3:     For each element A[i]:
4:         Check if A[i] is greater than A[i+1]
5:         If true, this indicates the point of rotation
6:             Set count to i + 1
7:             Break the loop
8: If the loop completes without finding a rotation point, the array is not rotated, and count remains 0
9: Return count
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def find_rotation_count(A):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(A) - 1):
        if A[i] > A[i + 1]:
            count = i + 1
            break
    return count
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `find_rotation_count` is designed to find the number of rotations in a circularly sorted array. A circularly sorted array is an array that was originally sorted in ascending order but has been rotated some number of times. The key to finding the number of rotations is to locate the point where the array is no longer in ascending order, which is the point of rotation. This point is identified by finding an element that is greater than the next element in the array. The index of this element plus one gives the number of rotations. If no such point is found, the array is either not rotated or is sorted in ascending order, and the function returns 0.
