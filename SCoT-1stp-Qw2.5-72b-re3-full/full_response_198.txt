[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: a, b: semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse
Output: area: the area of the largest triangle that can be inscribed in the ellipse

1: Understand the geometric property that the largest triangle inscribed in an ellipse is an equilateral triangle with one vertex at one of the foci of the ellipse and the other two vertices on the ellipse.
2: The area of the largest inscribed triangle in an ellipse is given by the formula: (3 * sqrt(3) * a * b) / 4, where a is the semi-major axis and b is the semi-minor axis.
3: Calculate the area using the formula.
4: Return the calculated area.

Explanation:
The largest triangle that can be inscribed in an ellipse is an equilateral triangle, and its area can be calculated using the formula (3 * sqrt(3) * a * b) / 4, where 'a' is the semi-major axis and 'b' is the semi-minor axis of the ellipse. This formula is derived from the geometric properties of ellipses and the specific configuration of the largest inscribed triangle. The function `largest_triangle` takes two parameters, 'a' and 'b', and returns the area of the largest inscribed triangle.
