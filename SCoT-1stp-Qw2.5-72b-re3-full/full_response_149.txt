Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list
Output: The length of the longest subsequence where the difference between adjacent elements is one.

1: Initialize a variable `max_length` to store the maximum length of the subsequence found so far, set it to 1.
2: Initialize a variable `current_length` to store the length of the current subsequence being checked, set it to 1.
3: Iterate through the array from the second element to the last element:
4:     If the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element is 1:
5:         Increment `current_length` by 1.
6:         If `current_length` is greater than `max_length`:
7:             Update `max_length` to `current_length`.
8:     Else:
9:         Reset `current_length` to 1.
10: Return `max_length`.

### Explanation:
The function `longest_subseq_with_diff_one` takes an array `arr` and its length `n` as input. The goal is to find the longest subsequence within the array where the difference between adjacent elements is exactly one.

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_length` is initialized to 1 because the minimum length of any subsequence is 1 (a single element).
   - `current_length` is also initialized to 1 to start tracking the length of the current subsequence.

2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop starts from the second element (index 1) and goes to the last element (index n-1).
   - For each element, it checks if the absolute difference between the current element and the previous element is 1.
   - If the condition is met, it increments `current_length` by 1.
   - If `current_length` exceeds `max_length`, `max_length` is updated to `current_length`.
   - If the condition is not met, `current_length` is reset to 1 to start a new subsequence.

3. **Return**:
   - After the loop, the function returns `max_length`, which is the length of the longest subsequence where the difference between adjacent elements is one.

This approach ensures that the function efficiently finds the longest subsequence with the desired property in a single pass through the array.
