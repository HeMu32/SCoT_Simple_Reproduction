[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: A list of digits (0-9)
Output: The largest number that can be formed with the given digits

1: Check if the input list is empty.
2: If the list is empty, return 0 or an appropriate message.
3: Sort the list of digits in descending order.
4: Convert the sorted list of digits into a single integer.
5: Return the integer as the largest number that can be formed.
[END PROCESS]

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** The function first checks if the input list `digits` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0 or an appropriate message indicating that no digits were provided.
- **Step 2:** If the list is not empty, the function sorts the list of digits in descending order. This ensures that the largest digit is placed at the highest significant position, forming the largest possible number.
- **Step 3:** The sorted list of digits is then converted into a single integer by joining the digits as strings and converting the resulting string back into an integer.
- **Step 4:** The function returns the integer, which represents the largest number that can be formed from the given digits.

This approach ensures that the function efficiently finds the largest number possible from the given digits.
