Input: A: a sorted list of integers, left_element: the left boundary of the search range, right_element: the right boundary of the search range
Output: The smallest missing element in the range [left_element, right_element] that is not present in the list A

1: Initialize a variable `missing` to `None` to keep track of the smallest missing element.
2: Iterate through the range from `left_element` to `right_element + 1` (inclusive).
3:     For each element `i` in this range:
4:         If `i` is not in the list `A`:
5:             Set `missing` to `i` and break the loop.
6: If `missing` is still `None` after the loop, it means all elements in the range are present in the list.
7: Return `missing`.

Explanation: The function iterates through each number in the specified range and checks if it is present in the sorted list `A`. The first number that is not found in the list is the smallest missing element. If all numbers in the range are present, the function returns `None`.
