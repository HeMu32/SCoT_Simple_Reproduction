[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: differences: a list of integers representing the differences between consecutive numbers in the input list
1: Initialize an empty list to store the differences
2: Use a loop to iterate over the list, starting from the first element and ending at the second-to-last element
3:     for each element (except the last one):
4:         calculate the difference between the current element and the next element
5:         append the difference to the differences list
6: Return the differences list

### Explanation:
The function `diff_consecutivenums` takes a list of integers `nums` as input and returns a new list containing the differences between each pair of consecutive numbers in the input list. The process involves:
- Initializing an empty list `differences` to store the results.
- Iterating over the input list using a for loop, but stopping before the last element to avoid an index out-of-range error.
- For each element in the list (except the last one), the difference between the current element and the next element is calculated and appended to the `differences` list.
- Finally, the `differences` list is returned, containing the differences between consecutive numbers.
