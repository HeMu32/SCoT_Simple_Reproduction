Input: root: the root node of a binary tree
Output: boolean value indicating whether the tree is balanced

1: Define a helper function `get_height` that returns the height of a subtree and a boolean indicating if the subtree is balanced.
2: If the root is None, return (0, True) as an empty tree is balanced and has height 0.
3: Recursively call `get_height` for the left and right subtrees.
4: If either subtree is not balanced, or the height difference between the left and right subtrees is greater than 1, return (max height of the two subtrees + 1, False).
5: Otherwise, return (max height of the two subtrees + 1, True).
6: In the main function `is_tree_balanced`, call `get_height` on the root and return the boolean part of the result.
