Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list
Output: inv_count: the number of inversions in the array

1: Initialize inv_count to 0
2: For each element in the array (i from 0 to n-1):
3:     For each subsequent element in the array (j from i+1 to n-1):
4:         If arr[i] is greater than arr[j]:
5:             Increment inv_count by 1
6: Return inv_count
