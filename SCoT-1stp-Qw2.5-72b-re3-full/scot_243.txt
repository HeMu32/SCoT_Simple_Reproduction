Input: lst: a list of tuples
Output: sorted_lst: a list of tuples sorted based on the occurrence of the first element of each tuple

1: Initialize an empty dictionary named count_dict to store the count of the first element of each tuple.
2: Loop through each tuple in lst:
3:     If the first element of the tuple is not in count_dict, add it with a count of 1.
4:     If the first element of the tuple is already in count_dict, increment its count by 1.
5: Define a helper function named sort_key that takes a tuple and returns the count of its first element from count_dict.
6: Sort lst using the sort_key function as the key.
7: Return the sorted list.
