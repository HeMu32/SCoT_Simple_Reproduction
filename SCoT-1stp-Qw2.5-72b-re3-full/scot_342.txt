Input: list: a list of lists, where each sublist represents an array of integers
Output: a tuple (start, end) representing the smallest range that includes at least one element from each of the given arrays

1: Initialize variables to store the minimum and maximum values of the current range, and the overall minimum range.
2: Use a min-heap to keep track of the minimum element from each array and the current range.
3: Initialize the heap with the first element of each array along with the array index and element index.
4: Set the initial minimum and maximum values based on the first elements of the arrays.
5: Loop until the heap is exhausted:
   - Pop the smallest element from the heap.
   - Update the overall minimum range if the current range is smaller.
   - If there are more elements in the array from which the smallest element was popped, push the next element from that array into the heap.
   - Update the maximum value of the current range if the new element is larger than the current maximum.
6: Return the overall minimum range.
