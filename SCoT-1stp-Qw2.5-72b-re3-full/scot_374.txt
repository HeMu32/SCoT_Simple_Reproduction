Input: str: a string for which permutations are to be generated
Output: Print all permutations of the given string, including duplicates

1: If the length of the string is 1, print the string and return (base case)
2: For each character in the string:
3:     Remove the character from the string and store it in a variable
4:     Generate permutations of the remaining string (recursive call)
5:     For each permutation generated in the recursive call:
6:         Add the removed character to the beginning of the permutation
7:         Print the new permutation
