Input: n: a natural number
Output: tetrahedral: the nth tetrahedral number

1: Validate the input to ensure it is a positive integer.
2: Calculate the nth tetrahedral number using the formula: \( \text{tetrahedral} = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} \).
3: Return the calculated tetrahedral number.

### Explanation:
The function `tetrahedral_number` calculates the nth tetrahedral number, which is a figurate number that represents a pyramid with a triangular base. The formula for the nth tetrahedral number is given by:

\[ \text{tetrahedral} = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6} \]

This formula is derived from the sum of the first n triangular numbers. The function first checks if the input `n` is a positive integer. If not, it raises a `ValueError`. If the input is valid, it calculates the tetrahedral number using the formula and returns the result. The use of integer division `//` ensures that the result is an integer, which is appropriate for this type of calculation.
