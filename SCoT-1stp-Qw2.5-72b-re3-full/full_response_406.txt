Input: x: an integer value for which the parity needs to be determined
Output: parity: a string indicating the parity of the number ("Even" or "Odd")

1: Initialize a variable `parity` to store the result
2: Use a branch to check if the number `x` is even or odd
3:     If `x` modulo 2 equals 0, set `parity` to "Even"
4:     Otherwise, set `parity` to "Odd"
5: Return the value of `parity`
[END PROCESS]

def find_Parity(x):
    # Determine if the number is even or odd
    if x % 2 == 0:
        parity = "Even"
    else:
        parity = "Odd"
    return parity
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `find_Parity` takes an integer `x` as input and returns a string indicating whether the number is "Even" or "Odd". The parity of a number is determined by checking the remainder when the number is divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even; otherwise, it is odd. The function uses a simple if-else statement to perform this check and assigns the appropriate string to the variable `parity`, which is then returned.
