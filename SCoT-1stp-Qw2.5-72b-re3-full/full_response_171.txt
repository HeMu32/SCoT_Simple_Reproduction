[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: a: the length of one side of a regular pentagon
Output: perimeter: the perimeter of the pentagon
1: Calculate the perimeter by multiplying the length of one side by 5, since a pentagon has five sides.
2: Return the calculated perimeter.
[END PROCESS]

def perimeter_pentagon(a):
    # Calculate the perimeter of the pentagon
    perimeter = 5 * a
    # Return the calculated perimeter
    return perimeter
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `perimeter_pentagon(a)` takes a single argument `a`, which represents the length of one side of a regular pentagon. The perimeter of a regular pentagon is simply the sum of the lengths of its five sides. Since all sides are of equal length in a regular pentagon, the perimeter can be calculated by multiplying the length of one side by 5. The function then returns this calculated perimeter.
