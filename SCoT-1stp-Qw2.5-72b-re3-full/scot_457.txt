Input: lst: a list of sublists  
Output: The sublist with the minimum length  
1: Initialize a variable `min_length` with a large number (like infinity) to keep track of the minimum length found so far  
2: Initialize a variable `min_sublist` to store the sublist with the minimum length  
3: Iterate through each sublist in the input list `lst`:  
4:     If the length of the current sublist is less than `min_length`:  
5:         Update `min_length` to the length of the current sublist  
6:         Update `min_sublist` to the current sublist  
7: Return `min_sublist`
