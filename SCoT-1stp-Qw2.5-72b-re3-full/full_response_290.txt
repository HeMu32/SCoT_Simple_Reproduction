[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list1: a list of lists
Output: a list of lists with the maximum length

1: Initialize a variable max_len to 0 to keep track of the maximum length found.
2: Initialize an empty list max_lists to store lists that have the maximum length.
3: Loop through each sublist in list1:
4:     If the length of the current sublist is greater than max_len:
5:         Update max_len to the length of the current sublist.
6:         Clear max_lists and add the current sublist to max_lists.
7:     Else if the length of the current sublist is equal to max_len:
8:         Add the current sublist to max_lists.
9: Return max_lists.

### Explanation:
The function `max_length` is designed to find and return all the lists within a given list of lists that have the maximum length. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `max_len` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the maximum length of any sublist encountered.
   - `max_lists` is initialized as an empty list to store the sublists that have the maximum length.

2. **Loop Through Sublists**:
   - The function iterates through each sublist in the input list `list1`.

3. **Update Maximum Length**:
   - If the length of the current sublist is greater than `max_len`, it updates `max_len` to the length of the current sublist and resets `max_lists` to contain only the current sublist.
   - If the length of the current sublist is equal to `max_len`, it appends the current sublist to `max_lists`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After the loop, the function returns `max_lists`, which contains all the sublists with the maximum length.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies and returns all sublists that have the maximum length, even if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length.
