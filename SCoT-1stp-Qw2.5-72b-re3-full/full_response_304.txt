Certainly! Let's break down the task and then implement the solution.

### Task Description:
Write a Python function to find the element at a given index after a specified number of rotations. The function should take a list, the number of rotations, and the index as input and return the element at the specified index after the rotations.

### Solving Process:
[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: 
- `arr`: a list of integers
- `rotations`: an integer representing the number of rotations
- `index`: an integer representing the index to find the element at

Output: 
- The element at the specified index after the rotations

1: Calculate the effective number of rotations needed. Since rotating a list by its length results in the same list, we can reduce the number of rotations to `rotations % len(arr)`.
2: If the effective number of rotations is 0, return the element at the given index directly.
3: Otherwise, calculate the new index after the rotations. The new index can be found using the formula: `(index + effective_rotations) % len(arr)`.
4: Return the element at the new index.
[END PROCESS]

### Code Implementation:
[BEGIN CODE]
def find_Element(arr, rotations, index):
    # Calculate the effective number of rotations
    effective_rotations = rotations % len(arr)
    
    # If no effective rotations, return the element at the given index
    if effective_rotations == 0:
        return arr[index]
    
    # Calculate the new index after the rotations
    new_index = (index + effective_rotations) % len(arr)
    
    # Return the element at the new index
    return arr[new_index]
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
1. **Effective Rotations Calculation**: We use `rotations % len(arr)` to find the effective number of rotations. This is because rotating a list by its length results in the same list, so any multiple of the list length can be ignored.
2. **Direct Return for No Rotations**: If the effective number of rotations is 0, the list remains unchanged, and we can directly return the element at the given index.
3. **New Index Calculation**: For non-zero effective rotations, we calculate the new index using the formula `(index + effective_rotations) % len(arr)`. This formula ensures that the index wraps around the list if it exceeds the list length.
4. **Return the Element**: Finally, we return the element at the new index.

This approach ensures that the function is efficient and handles edge cases correctly.
