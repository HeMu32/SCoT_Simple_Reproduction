Input: n: an integer indicating the number of Perrin numbers to sum
Output: The sum of the first n Perrin numbers

1: Initialize a list `perrin` to store the first n Perrin numbers.
2: Set the first three Perrin numbers:
3:     - perrin[0] = 3
4:     - perrin[1] = 0
5:     - perrin[2] = 2
6: If n is less than or equal to 2:
7:     Return the sum of the first n elements in the perrin list
8: For i from 3 to n-1:
9:     Calculate perrin[i] as perrin[i-2] + perrin[i-3]
10: Return the sum of all elements in the perrin list
