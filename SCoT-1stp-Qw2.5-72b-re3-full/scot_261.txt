Input: test_tup1: a tuple of numbers, test_tup2: a tuple of numbers
Output: result_tup: a tuple containing the result of element-wise division of test_tup1 by test_tup2

1: Initialize an empty list result_list to store the division results
2: for each pair of elements (num1, num2) from test_tup1 and test_tup2 respectively:
3:     if num2 is 0:
4:         raise a ValueError indicating division by zero
5:     else:
6:         calculate the division of num1 by num2
7:         append the result to result_list
8: convert result_list to a tuple result_tup
9: return result_tup
