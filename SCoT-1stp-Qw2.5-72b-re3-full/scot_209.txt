Input: heap: a list representing a min-heap, a: an integer to be inserted
Output: None (the function modifies the heap in place)

1: Import the `heapq` module to use heap operations.
2: Use the `heapreplace` function from the `heapq` module to pop the smallest element from the heap and push the new item `a` onto the heap in a single operation.
3: The function does not return anything as the heap is modified in place.
