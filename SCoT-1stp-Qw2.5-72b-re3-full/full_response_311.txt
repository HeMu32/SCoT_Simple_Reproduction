[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer
Output: result: an integer with the leftmost unset bit set

1: Convert the integer `n` to its binary representation.
2: Identify the position of the leftmost unset bit (0) in the binary representation.
3: If no unset bit is found (i.e., all bits are 1), return `n` as it is.
4: Otherwise, create a mask with a single bit set at the position of the identified unset bit.
5: Apply the OR operation between `n` and the mask to set the identified bit.
6: Return the result of the OR operation.

### Explanation:
1. **Convert to Binary and Check for All Set Bits:**
   - The function first checks if `n` is 0. If `n` is 0, the leftmost unset bit is the first bit, so the function returns 1 (binary 1).
   - If `n` is not 0, the function proceeds to find the leftmost unset bit.

2. **Find the Leftmost Unset Bit:**
   - A mask is initialized to 1 (binary 0001).
   - The function uses a while loop to shift the mask left until it finds an unset bit (0) in `n`. The condition `n & mask` checks if the current bit in `n` is set (1). If it is, the mask is shifted left by one position.
   - When the loop exits, the mask will have a 1 at the position of the leftmost unset bit in `n`.

3. **Set the Leftmost Unset Bit:**
   - The function then applies the OR operation between `n` and the mask. This operation sets the leftmost unset bit in `n` to 1.
   - The result of the OR operation is returned.

This approach ensures that the leftmost unset bit is set correctly, and the function handles edge cases like `n` being 0.
