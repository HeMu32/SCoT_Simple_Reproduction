Input: n: an integer
Output: The next bigger number formed by rearranging the digits of n, or -1 if it is not possible

1: Convert the integer n to a list of its digits.
2: Identify the first digit from the right that is smaller than the digit immediately to its right. This is the pivot.
3: If no such digit is found, it means the digits are in descending order, and no larger number can be formed. Return -1.
4: Find the smallest digit on the right side of the pivot that is larger than the pivot.
5: Swap the pivot with this digit.
6: Sort the digits to the right of the pivot's original position in ascending order.
7: Convert the list of digits back to an integer.
8: Return the new integer.
