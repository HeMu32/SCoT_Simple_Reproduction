[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer representing half the length of the binary sequences
Output: The count of all binary sequences of length 2n such that the sum of the first n bits is the same as the sum of the last n bits

1: Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the valid sequences.
2: Generate all possible binary sequences of length 2n.
3: For each sequence:
   a: Split the sequence into two halves.
   b: Calculate the sum of the bits in the first half and the second half.
   c: If the sums are equal, increment `count`.
4: Return the `count` of valid sequences.

### Explanation:
The function `count_binary_seq` calculates the number of binary sequences of length 2n where the sum of the first n bits is equal to the sum of the last n bits. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a counter `count` to 0, which will keep track of the number of valid sequences.

2. **Generating Sequences**: We use the `product` function from the `itertools` module to generate all possible binary sequences of length 2n. Each sequence is a tuple of 0s and 1s.

3. **Splitting and Summing**: For each generated sequence, we split it into two halves. We then calculate the sum of the bits in each half.

4. **Checking Equality**: If the sums of the two halves are equal, we increment the `count`.

5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return the `count` of valid sequences.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible binary sequences and accurately count those that meet the given condition.
