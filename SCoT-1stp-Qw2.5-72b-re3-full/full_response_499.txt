### Explanation:
The function `diameter_circle` takes a single parameter `r`, which represents the radius of the circle. The function first checks if the radius is a positive number. If it is, the diameter is calculated by multiplying the radius by 2, and the result is returned. If the radius is not positive, the function raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate message. This ensures that the function only processes valid input and provides clear feedback when the input is invalid.
