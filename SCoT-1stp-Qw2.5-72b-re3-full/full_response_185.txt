Input: a, b, c: coefficients of the parabola equation in the form y = ax^2 + bx + c
Output: focus: a tuple (x, y) representing the coordinates of the focus of the parabola

1: Calculate the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula x_vertex = -b / (2 * a)
2: Calculate the y-coordinate of the vertex using the formula y_vertex = c - b^2 / (4 * a)
3: Calculate the distance from the vertex to the focus using the formula distance = 1 / (4 * a)
4: Determine the y-coordinate of the focus by adding the distance to the y-coordinate of the vertex
5: Return the focus as a tuple (x_vertex, y_focus)

### Explanation:
The focus of a parabola given by the equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) can be found using the following steps:

1. **Vertex Calculation**:
   - The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( x_{\text{vertex}} = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
   - The y-coordinate of the vertex is given by \( y_{\text{vertex}} = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} \).

2. **Focus Calculation**:
   - The distance from the vertex to the focus is \( \frac{1}{4a} \).
   - The y-coordinate of the focus is \( y_{\text{focus}} = y_{\text{vertex}} + \frac{1}{4a} \).

3. **Return the Focus**:
   - The focus is returned as a tuple \( (x_{\text{vertex}}, y_{\text{focus}}) \).

This function correctly calculates the focus of the parabola based on the given coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).
