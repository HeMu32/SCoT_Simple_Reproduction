Input: list_nums: a list of integers
Output: The largest product of the pair of adjacent elements in the list

1: Initialize a variable max_product to store the maximum product found, set it to the product of the first two elements in the list.
2: Iterate through the list starting from the second element to the second last element.
3:   For each element, calculate the product of the current element and the next element.
4:   If the calculated product is greater than max_product, update max_product with the new value.
5: After the loop, return max_product as the result.

### Explanation:
The function `adjacent_num_product` is designed to find the largest product of adjacent elements in a given list of integers. The process starts by initializing `max_product` with the product of the first two elements to ensure that we have a starting point for comparison. The loop then iterates through the list, starting from the second element and stopping at the second-to-last element, to avoid index out-of-range errors. For each element, the product of the current element and the next element is calculated and compared with `max_product`. If the new product is greater, `max_product` is updated. After the loop completes, the function returns the largest product found. This approach ensures that all pairs of adjacent elements are considered, and the maximum product is accurately determined.
