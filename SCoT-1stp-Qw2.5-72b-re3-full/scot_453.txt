Input: A number `n` for which we need to find the sum of even factors.
Output: The sum of all even factors of `n`.

1: Initialize a variable `sum_even_factors` to 0 to store the sum of even factors.
2: Loop through numbers from 2 to `n` (inclusive) with a step of 2 to only consider even numbers.
3:     For each even number `i`:
4:         If `i` is a factor of `n` (i.e., `n % i == 0`):
5:             Add `i` to `sum_even_factors`.
6: After the loop, return `sum_even_factors`.
