Input: Input: a list of tuples, k: an integer (though k is not used in this function, it's included in the function signature)
Output: A boolean value indicating whether all tuples in the list have the same length

1: Initialize a variable `first_length` to store the length of the first tuple in the list
2: Initialize a boolean variable `all_equal` to True
3: For each tuple `tup` in the list:
4:     If the length of `tup` is not equal to `first_length`:
5:         Set `all_equal` to False
6:         Break the loop
7: Return `all_equal`
