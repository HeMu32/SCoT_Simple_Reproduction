Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the number of elements in arr
Output: sum: the sum of absolute differences in all pairs of the given array

1: Initialize `sum` to 0
2: Sort the array `arr` to make the calculation of absolute differences easier
3: Loop through each element `i` in the range from 0 to n-1
4:     For each element `j` in the range from i+1 to n
5:         Calculate the absolute difference between `arr[j]` and `arr[i]`
6:         Add the absolute difference to `sum`
7: Return `sum`
