Input: r: a float or integer representing the radius of the sphere
Output: surface_area: a float representing the surface area of the sphere

1: Import the math module to access the value of pi
2: Define a function surfacearea_sphere with a parameter r
3:   Calculate the surface area using the formula 4 * pi * r^2
4:   Return the calculated surface area
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]

def surfacearea_sphere(r):
  surface_area = 4 * math.pi * r ** 2
  return surface_area
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `surfacearea_sphere` calculates the surface area of a sphere given its radius `r`. The formula for the surface area of a sphere is \(4 \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere. The `math` module is used to access the value of \(\pi\). The function computes the surface area using this formula and returns the result. This implementation is straightforward and uses a simple mathematical formula, so it does not require complex control structures like loops or branches.
