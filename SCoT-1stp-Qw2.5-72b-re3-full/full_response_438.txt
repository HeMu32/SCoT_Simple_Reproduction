[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_list: a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a pair of elements
Output: count: an integer representing the number of bidirectional pairs in the list

1: Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of bidirectional pairs
2: Loop through each tuple `pair` in `test_list` using an index `i`
3:     For each `pair`, loop through the remaining tuples in `test_list` starting from the next index `i + 1`
4:         If the reverse of the current `pair` (i.e., `pair` with elements swapped) is found in the remaining tuples, increment `count` by 1
5: Return the final value of `count`
[END PROCESS]

### Explanation:
The function `count_bidirectional` is designed to count the number of bidirectional pairs in a list of tuples. A bidirectional pair is defined as a tuple where the elements are the same but in reverse order compared to another tuple in the list.

1. **Initialization**: The variable `count` is initialized to 0 to keep track of the number of bidirectional pairs.
2. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates through each tuple in `test_list` using an index `i`.
3. **Inner Loop**: The inner loop iterates through the remaining tuples in `test_list` starting from the next index `i + 1` to avoid counting the same pair twice and to avoid comparing a tuple with itself.
4. **Comparison**: Inside the inner loop, the function checks if the reverse of the current tuple `pair` (i.e., `pair` with elements swapped) is equal to the current tuple in the inner loop `test_list[j]`. If they are equal, it means a bidirectional pair is found, and `count` is incremented by 1.
5. **Return**: After both loops complete, the function returns the final value of `count`, which represents the number of bidirectional pairs in the list.

This approach ensures that each pair is only counted once and that the function efficiently checks for bidirectional pairs by leveraging the properties of tuple comparison and slicing.
