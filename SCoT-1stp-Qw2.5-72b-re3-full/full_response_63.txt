[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_list: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers
Output: max_diff: the maximum difference between the two integers in any of the tuples

1: Initialize max_diff to 0
2: For each tuple (a, b) in test_list:
3:     Calculate the absolute difference between a and b and store it in diff
4:     If diff is greater than max_diff:
5:         Set max_diff to diff
6: Return max_diff
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def max_difference(test_list):
    max_diff = 0
    for a, b in test_list:
        diff = abs(a - b)
        if diff > max_diff:
            max_diff = diff
    return max_diff
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `max_difference` is designed to find the maximum difference between the two integers in any of the tuples within the given list `test_list`. The process involves iterating through each tuple in the list, calculating the absolute difference between the two integers in the tuple, and keeping track of the maximum difference encountered. The final maximum difference is then returned as the result. This approach ensures that the function efficiently finds the maximum difference by only requiring a single pass through the list.
