[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: str: a string
Output: A new string with characters at odd indices removed

1: Initialize an empty string called result to store the characters at even indices
2: for i from 0 to the length of str - 1:
3:     if i is even (i.e., i % 2 == 0):
4:         Append the character at index i of str to result
5: return result
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def odd_values_string(str):
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(str)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            result += str[i]
    return result
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `odd_values_string` takes a single string `str` as input and returns a new string with characters at odd indices removed. The function works by iterating over the indices of the input string using a for loop. For each index, it checks if the index is even (i.e., divisible by 2 with no remainder). If the index is even, the character at that index is appended to the `result` string. After the loop completes, the `result` string, which contains only the characters at even indices, is returned. This approach ensures that characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.) are not included in the final output.
