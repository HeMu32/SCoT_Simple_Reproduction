Input: d: a dictionary which may contain nested dictionaries
Output: depth: an integer representing the depth of the dictionary

1: Define a function dict_depth with a parameter d
2:   Initialize a variable depth to 1, representing the minimum depth of a dictionary
3:   Check if d is not a dictionary or if it is empty:
4:     If true, return 0 as the depth
5:   Initialize a variable max_depth to 0 to keep track of the maximum depth found
6:   Iterate over each key-value pair in the dictionary d:
7:     If the value is a dictionary:
8:       Recursively call dict_depth on the value to find its depth
9:       Update max_depth if the depth of the current value is greater than max_depth
10:  Return max_depth + 1 as the final depth of the dictionary
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def dict_depth(d):
    if not isinstance(d, dict) or not d:
        return 0
    max_depth = 0
    for value in d.values():
        if isinstance(value, dict):
            max_depth = max(max_depth, dict_depth(value))
    return max_depth + 1
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `dict_depth` is designed to calculate the depth of a dictionary, where the depth is defined as the number of levels of nested dictionaries. The function works as follows:

1. **Base Case**: If the input `d` is not a dictionary or is an empty dictionary, the function returns 0. This handles the case where there are no nested dictionaries or the input is invalid.

2. **Recursive Case**: For each value in the dictionary, if the value is itself a dictionary, the function recursively calls itself to find the depth of that nested dictionary. The maximum depth found among all nested dictionaries is stored in `max_depth`.

3. **Final Depth Calculation**: The final depth of the dictionary is `max_depth + 1`, where `1` accounts for the current level of the dictionary.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles nested dictionaries of any depth and returns the correct depth.
