Input: n: an integer representing the number of elements in the binomial coefficient sequence
Output: sum: the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices

1: Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to store the sum of the even index binomial coefficients
2: For each index `i` from 0 to n (inclusive):
3:     If `i` is even:
4:         Calculate the binomial coefficient for `n` choose `i`
5:         Add the calculated binomial coefficient to `sum`
6: Return `sum`
