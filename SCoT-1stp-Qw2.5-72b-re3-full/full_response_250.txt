[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: tup: a tuple, x: an element to count
Output: the number of occurrences of x in the tuple

1: Initialize a counter variable to 0
2: Loop through each element in the tuple
3:     If the current element is equal to x, increment the counter by 1
4: After the loop, return the counter value
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def count_X(tup, x):
    count = 0
    for element in tup:
        if element == x:
            count += 1
    return count
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `count_X` takes two parameters: `tup`, which is the tuple to search through, and `x`, which is the element to count within the tuple. The function initializes a counter to 0, then iterates over each element in the tuple. For each element, it checks if the element is equal to `x`. If it is, the counter is incremented by 1. After the loop completes, the function returns the counter, which represents the number of times `x` appears in the tuple. This approach uses a simple loop and a conditional statement to achieve the desired functionality.
