Output: A new tuple that is a slice of the original tuple from index m to n (exclusive)
1: Check if m and n are within the bounds of the tuple length
2: If m and n are valid:
3:     Slice the tuple from index m to n
4:     Return the sliced tuple
5: If m or n are out of bounds:
6:     Return an error message or an empty tuple
