[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: text: a string containing words of various lengths
Output: result: a list of words that are exactly three, four, or five characters long
1: Import the regex module (re)
2: Define a regex pattern to match words that are 3, 4, or 5 characters long
3: Use the regex pattern to find all matches in the input text
4: Store the matches in a list
5: Return the list of matched words
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
import re

def find_char(text):
    # Define the regex pattern to match words of 3, 4, or 5 characters
    pattern = r'\b\w{3,5}\b'
    
    # Find all matches in the text
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
    
    # Return the list of matched words
    return matches
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
- **Regex Pattern Explanation:**
  - `\b`: Asserts a word boundary, ensuring that the match is a whole word.
  - `\w{3,5}`: Matches any word character (alphanumeric and underscore) that is between 3 and 5 characters long.
  - `\b`: Asserts another word boundary to ensure the match ends at the word boundary.
- **Function Steps:**
  1. **Import the `re` module:** This module provides support for regular expressions in Python.
  2. **Define the regex pattern:** The pattern `\b\w{3,5}\b` is used to match words that are exactly 3, 4, or 5 characters long.
  3. **Find all matches:** The `re.findall` function is used to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input text.
  4. **Return the matches:** The function returns a list of all matched words.

This function will correctly identify and return all words in the input text that are 3, 4, or 5 characters long.
