Input: str: a string
Output: The length of the longest repeating subsequence with no same characters at the same positions

1: Initialize a 2D list dp of size n x n with all elements set to 0, where n is the length of the string.
2: Loop i from 1 to n (incrementing by 1):
3:     Loop j from 1 to n (incrementing by 1):
4:         If str[i-1] is equal to str[j-1] and i is not equal to j:
5:             Set dp[i][j] to 1 + dp[i-1][j-1].
6:         Else:
7:             Set dp[i][j] to the maximum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1].
8: Return dp[n][n] as the length of the longest repeating subsequence.
