[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: A number `n` for which we need to find the sum of even factors.
Output: The sum of all even factors of `n`.

1: Initialize a variable `sum_even_factors` to 0 to store the sum of even factors.
2: Loop through numbers from 2 to `n` (inclusive) with a step of 2 to only consider even numbers.
3:     For each even number `i`:
4:         If `i` is a factor of `n` (i.e., `n % i == 0`):
5:             Add `i` to `sum_even_factors`.
6: After the loop, return `sum_even_factors`.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def sumofFactors(n):
    sum_even_factors = 0
    for i in range(2, n + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            sum_even_factors += i
    return sum_even_factors
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `sumofFactors` is designed to calculate the sum of all even factors of a given number `n`. The process involves iterating through all even numbers from 2 up to `n` and checking if each number is a factor of `n`. If it is, the number is added to the `sum_even_factors`. This approach ensures that only even factors are considered, and the sum of these factors is returned as the result. The loop increments by 2 to skip odd numbers, optimizing the function's performance.
