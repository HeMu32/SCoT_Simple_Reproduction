Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the array
Output: res: the maximum product of an increasing subsequence of the array

1: Initialize a list dp of the same length as arr, where each element is set to the corresponding element in arr. This list will store the maximum product of an increasing subsequence ending at each index.
2: Initialize a variable res to store the maximum product found, initially set to the first element of arr.
3: Use a nested loop to iterate over the array:
4:     For each element arr[j] (where j is the outer loop index):
5:         For each element arr[i] (where i is the inner loop index and i < j):
6:             If arr[j] is greater than arr[i] (indicating an increasing subsequence):
7:                 Update dp[j] to be the maximum of dp[j] and dp[i] * arr[j].
8:             Update res to be the maximum of res and dp[j].
9: Return res as the maximum product of an increasing subsequence.

### Explanation:
The function `max_product` is designed to find the maximum product of an increasing subsequence in the given array `arr`. The approach uses dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum product that can be achieved ending at each index. The `dp` array is initialized with the values of `arr`, and each element `dp[j]` is updated based on the maximum product that can be achieved by including `arr[j]` in the subsequence, considering all previous elements `arr[i]` (where `i < j`) that form an increasing subsequence with `arr[j]`. The result `res` is updated to keep track of the maximum product found during the iteration. This ensures that the final result is the maximum product of any increasing subsequence in the array.
