Input: n: an integer representing the number of terms in the harmonic series to sum up to n-1.
Output: A float representing the harmonic sum of n-1.

1: If n is less than or equal to 1, return 1 as the base case (since the harmonic sum of 0 is 1).
2: Otherwise, return the sum of 1/n and the harmonic sum of n-1.
3: This process is repeated recursively until the base case is reached.
