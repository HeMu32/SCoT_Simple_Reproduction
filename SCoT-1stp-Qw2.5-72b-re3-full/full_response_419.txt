[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list1: a list of floating-point numbers
Output: The total sum of the rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list

1: Initialize a variable `total_sum` to 0 to store the sum of the rounded numbers.
2: Loop through each number in `list1`:
3:     Round the current number to the nearest integer.
4:     Add the rounded number to `total_sum`.
5: After the loop, multiply `total_sum` by the length of `list1`.
6: Print the result of the multiplication.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def round_and_sum(list1):
    total_sum = 0
    for number in list1:
        rounded_number = round(number)
        total_sum += rounded_number
    result = total_sum * len(list1)
    print(result)
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
- **Step 1:** Initialize `total_sum` to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the sum of the rounded numbers.
- **Step 2:** Use a `for` loop to iterate through each number in the input list `list1`.
- **Step 3:** Inside the loop, use the `round()` function to round the current number to the nearest integer.
- **Step 4:** Add the rounded number to `total_sum`.
- **Step 5:** After the loop, multiply `total_sum` by the length of `list1` to get the final result.
- **Step 6:** Print the final result.

This function will correctly round each number in the list, sum them up, and then multiply the sum by the length of the list, printing the final result.
