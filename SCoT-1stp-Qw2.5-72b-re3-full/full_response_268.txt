### Explanation

A star number is a figurate number that represents a centered hexagram (six-pointed star), such as the one that Chinese checkers is played on. The formula to find the n-th star number is given by:

\[ S_n = 6n(n - 1) + 1 \]

Where:
- \( S_n \) is the n-th star number.
- \( n \) is the position of the star number in the sequence.

The function `find_star_num` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n-th star number by applying the formula. The formula is derived from the geometric properties of a centered hexagram, where each new layer of the star adds a multiple of 6 to the previous star number. The initial star number (when \( n = 1 \)) is 1, which is the center of the hexagram. For each subsequent layer, the number of points added is \( 6(n - 1) \), and this is summed up to get the total number of points in the n-th star.
