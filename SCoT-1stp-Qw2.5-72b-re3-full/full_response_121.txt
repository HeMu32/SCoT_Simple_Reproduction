Certainly! Let's break down the task and then implement the solution.

### Understanding the Requirement

The function `check_triplet(A, n, sum, count)` is designed to find if there exists a triplet in the array `A` of length `n` such that the sum of the triplet equals the given `sum`. The function should return the number of such triplets found.

### Solving Process

[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input:
- `A`: a list of integers
- `n`: the length of the list `A`
- `sum`: the target sum for the triplet
- `count`: a variable to keep track of the number of triplets found

Output:
- `count`: the number of triplets in `A` that sum up to `sum`

1: Initialize `count` to 0
2: Use three nested loops to iterate through all possible triplets in the array `A`
3: For each triplet (i, j, k) where i < j < k:
4:     Calculate the sum of the triplet A[i] + A[j] + A[k]
5:     If the sum of the triplet equals the target `sum`:
6:         Increment `count` by 1
7: Return `count`
[END PROCESS]

### Code Implementation

[BEGIN CODE]
def check_triplet(A, n, sum, count):
    # Initialize count to 0
    count = 0

    # Use three nested loops to iterate through all possible triplets
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                # Calculate the sum of the triplet
                triplet_sum = A[i] + A[j] + A[k]
                # Check if the sum of the triplet equals the target sum
                if triplet_sum == sum:
                    # Increment count by 1
                    count += 1

    # Return the count of triplets
    return count
[END CODE]

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `count` to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of triplets that sum up to the target `sum`.

2. **Triple Nested Loops**: We use three nested loops to iterate through all possible triplets in the array `A`. The outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1`, the middle loop runs from `i+1` to `n-1`, and the inner loop runs from `j+1` to `n-1`. This ensures that each triplet (i, j, k) is unique and i < j < k.

3. **Sum Calculation**: For each triplet, we calculate the sum of the elements `A[i]`, `A[j]`, and `A[k]`.

4. **Condition Check**: We check if the sum of the triplet equals the target `sum`. If it does, we increment `count` by 1.

5. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the value of `count`, which represents the number of triplets that sum up to the target `sum`.

This approach ensures that we check all possible triplets in the array and count those that meet the given condition. The time complexity of this solution is O(n^3), which is acceptable for small to moderately sized arrays. For larger arrays, more efficient algorithms (e.g., using sorting and two-pointer technique) would be necessary.
