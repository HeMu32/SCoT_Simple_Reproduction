Input: n: a non-negative integer
Output: count: the number of prime numbers less than n

1: Initialize count to 0 (to keep track of the number of primes)
2: Loop from 2 to n - 1 (since 0 and 1 are not prime)
3:     Initialize is_prime to True (assume the current number is prime)
4:     Loop from 2 to the square root of the current number (inclusive)
5:         If the current number is divisible by any number in this range:
6:             Set is_prime to False
7:             Break the loop
8:     If is_prime is still True after the inner loop:
9:         Increment count by 1
10: Return count
