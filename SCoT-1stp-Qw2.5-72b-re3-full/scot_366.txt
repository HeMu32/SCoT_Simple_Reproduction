Input: list_nums: a list of integers
Output: The largest product of the pair of adjacent elements in the list

1: Initialize a variable max_product to store the maximum product found, set it to the product of the first two elements in the list.
2: Iterate through the list starting from the second element to the second last element.
3:   For each element, calculate the product of the current element and the next element.
4:   If the calculated product is greater than max_product, update max_product with the new value.
5: After the loop, return max_product as the result.
