[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: A: a sorted list of integers, x: an integer to find the last occurrence of
Output: index: the index of the last occurrence of x in A, or -1 if x is not found

1: Initialize index to -1
2: Loop through each element in A with its index
3:     If the current element equals x
4:         Set index to the current index
5: After the loop, return index
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def find_last_occurrence(A, x):
    index = -1
    for i, value in enumerate(A):
        if value == x:
            index = i
    return index
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `find_last_occurrence` is designed to find the index of the last occurrence of a given number `x` in a sorted array `A`. The process involves iterating through the array while keeping track of the index of the last occurrence of `x`. If `x` is found, the current index is stored in the variable `index`. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `index`, which will be the index of the last occurrence of `x` or -1 if `x` is not found in the array. This approach ensures that the function correctly handles both cases where `x` is present and where it is not.
