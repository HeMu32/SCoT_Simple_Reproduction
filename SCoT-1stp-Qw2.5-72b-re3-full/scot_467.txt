Input: deciNum: an integer representing the decimal number to be converted to octal
Output: octal: a string representing the octal equivalent of the decimal number

1: Initialize an empty string called `octal` to store the octal digits
2: Initialize a variable `deciNum` with the input decimal number
3: While `deciNum` is greater than 0:
4:     Compute the remainder of `deciNum` divided by 8 and convert it to a string
5:     Prepend the remainder to the `octal` string
6:     Update `deciNum` by performing integer division by 8
7: If the `octal` string is empty, set it to "0"
8: Return the `octal` string
