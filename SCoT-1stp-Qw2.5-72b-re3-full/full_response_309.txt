[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: a: an integer or float, b: an integer or float
Output: The maximum value between a and b

1: Define the function `maximum` with parameters `a` and `b`
2: Compare `a` and `b` using a conditional statement
3:   If `a` is greater than `b`, return `a`
4:   Otherwise, return `b`
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def maximum(a, b):
    if a > b:
        return a
    else:
        return b
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `maximum` is designed to find the maximum value between two numbers, `a` and `b`. The process involves a simple comparison using an `if-else` statement. If `a` is greater than `b`, the function returns `a`; otherwise, it returns `b`. This approach ensures that the function always returns the larger of the two numbers. The use of a conditional statement (branch) is the key structure in this solution, as it allows the function to make a decision based on the comparison of the two inputs.
