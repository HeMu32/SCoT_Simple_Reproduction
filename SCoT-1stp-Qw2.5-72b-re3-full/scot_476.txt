Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: sum_of_extremes: the sum of the largest and smallest values in the list

1: Check if the list is empty; if it is, return 0 as there are no elements to sum.
2: Initialize two variables, `min_val` and `max_val`, to the first element of the list.
3: Iterate through the list starting from the second element.
4: For each element, compare it with `min_val` and `max_val`.
5: If the current element is less than `min_val`, update `min_val`.
6: If the current element is greater than `max_val`, update `max_val`.
7: After the loop, calculate the sum of `min_val` and `max_val`.
8: Return the sum.
