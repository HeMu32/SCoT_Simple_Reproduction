[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: N: an integer
Output: The closest smaller number than N

1: If N is less than or equal to 0:
2:     Return N - 1 (since there's no positive number smaller than 0, and for 0, the closest smaller number is -1)
3: Otherwise:
4:     Return N - 1 (the closest smaller number to any positive integer N is N - 1)
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def closest_num(N):
    if N <= 0:
        return N - 1
    else:
        return N - 1
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `closest_num(N)` is designed to find the closest smaller number than the given integer `N`. The logic is straightforward:
- If `N` is less than or equal to 0, the closest smaller number is `N - 1`. For example, if `N` is 0, the closest smaller number is -1.
- If `N` is a positive integer, the closest smaller number is simply `N - 1`.

This function handles both positive and non-positive integers correctly, ensuring that the output is always the closest smaller number to the input `N`.
