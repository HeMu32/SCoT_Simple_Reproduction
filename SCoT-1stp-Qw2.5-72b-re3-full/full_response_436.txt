### Explanation:
The function `neg_nos` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list containing only the negative numbers from the input list. The process involves:
1. **Initialization**: An empty list `negative_numbers` is created to store the negative numbers.
2. **Iteration**: A loop iterates over each element in the input list `list1`.
3. **Condition Check**: For each element, the function checks if it is less than zero (negative).
4. **Appending**: If the element is negative, it is appended to the `negative_numbers` list.
5. **Return**: Finally, the function returns the list of negative numbers.

This approach ensures that only the negative numbers are included in the output list, and it is efficient and straightforward.
