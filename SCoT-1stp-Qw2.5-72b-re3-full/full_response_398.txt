[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: a list of integers where each element is the sum of the digits of the corresponding number in the input list

1: Initialize an empty list to store the sum of digits for each number
2: Loop through each number in the input list
3:   Convert the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit
4:   Initialize a variable to store the sum of digits for the current number
5:   Loop through each character in the string representation of the number
6:     Convert the character back to an integer and add it to the sum of digits
7:   Append the sum of digits to the result list
8: Return the result list
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def sum_of_digits(nums):
    result = []
    for num in nums:
        num_str = str(num)
        digit_sum = 0
        for char in num_str:
            digit_sum += int(char)

### Explanation:
The function `sum_of_digits` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of integers where each element is the sum of the digits of the corresponding number in the input list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Initialization**: An empty list `result` is initialized to store the sum of digits for each number.
2. **Loop through each number**: A for loop iterates over each number in the input list `nums`.
3. **Convert to string**: Each number is converted to a string using `str(num)` to allow easy iteration over each digit.
4. **Initialize sum of digits**: A variable `digit_sum` is initialized to 0 to store the sum of digits for the current number.
5. **Loop through each digit**: Another for loop iterates over each character in the string representation of the number.
6. **Convert and add**: Each character is converted back to an integer using `int(char)` and added to `digit_sum`.
7. **Append to result**: After the inner loop completes, the sum of digits for the current number is appended to the `result` list.
8. **Return result**: After the outer loop completes, the `result` list is returned, containing the sum of digits for each number in the input list.

This approach ensures that the function correctly computes the sum of digits for each number in the input list and returns the results in a new list.
