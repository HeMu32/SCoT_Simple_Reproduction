Input: base, height, length: three positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and the length of the prism, respectively.
Output: volume: the volume of the triangular prism.

1: Calculate the area of the triangular base using the formula (base * height) / 2.
2: Multiply the area of the base by the length of the prism to get the volume.
3: Return the volume.
