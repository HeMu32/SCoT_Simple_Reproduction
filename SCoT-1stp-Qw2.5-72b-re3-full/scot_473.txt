Input: test_list1, test_list2: two lists of tuples
Output: intersection: a list of tuples that are present in both test_list1 and test_list2, irrespective of the order of elements in the tuples

1: Initialize an empty list `intersection` to store the result.
2: For each tuple `t1` in `test_list1`:
3:     For each tuple `t2` in `test_list2`:
4:         If the sorted version of `t1` is equal to the sorted version of `t2`:
5:             Add `t1` to `intersection` and break the inner loop to avoid duplicate entries.
6: Return `intersection`.
