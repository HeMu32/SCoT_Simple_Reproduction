[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_tup: a tuple, N: an integer representing the number of times to repeat the tuple
Output: result: a new tuple where the original tuple is repeated N times

1: Check if N is a positive integer
2: If N is less than 1:
3:     Return an empty tuple
4: Else:
5:     Use the * operator to repeat the tuple N times
6:     Assign the result to a variable named result
7: Return result
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def repeat_tuples(test_tup, N):
    if N < 1:
        return ()
    else:
        result = test_tup * N
        return result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `repeat_tuples` takes two parameters: `test_tup`, which is the tuple to be repeated, and `N`, which is the number of times the tuple should be repeated. The function first checks if `N` is a positive integer. If `N` is less than 1, it returns an empty tuple, as repeating a tuple 0 or a negative number of times doesn't make sense. If `N` is a positive integer, the function uses the multiplication operator `*` to repeat the tuple `N` times and returns the resulting tuple. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in tuple operations.
