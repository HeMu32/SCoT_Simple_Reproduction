Input: A number (integer)
Output: A number with all odd bits toggled

1: Define the function even_bit_toggle_number with a parameter num
2: Initialize a variable mask to 0
3: Initialize a variable bit_position to 0
4: Loop while (1 << bit_position) is less than or equal to num:
5:     If bit_position is odd:
6:         Set the bit at bit_position in mask
7:     Increment bit_position by 1
8: XOR num with mask to toggle all odd bits
9: Return the result of the XOR operation
