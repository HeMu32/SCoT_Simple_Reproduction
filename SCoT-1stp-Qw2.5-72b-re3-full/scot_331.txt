Input: n: an integer
Output: count: the number of unset (0) bits in the binary representation of n

1: Convert the integer n to its binary representation as a string, excluding the '0b' prefix.
2: Initialize a counter variable count to 0.
3: Loop through each character in the binary string:
4:     If the character is '0':
5:         Increment the count by 1.
