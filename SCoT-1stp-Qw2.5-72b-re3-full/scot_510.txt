Input: arr: a list of non-negative integers, k: a positive integer
Output: count: the number of subsequences where the product of elements is less than k

1: Initialize count to 0
2: for each subsequence of arr:
3:     Initialize product to 1
4:     for each element in the subsequence:
5:         Multiply the element to the product
6:     if the product is less than k:
7:         Increment count by 1
8: return count
