Input: str: a string
Output: The longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) in the given string

1: Define a function `lps` that takes a string `str` as input.
2: Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `n x n` (where `n` is the length of the string) with all elements set to 0. This array will be used to store the length of the longest palindromic subsequence for substrings of `str`.
3: Every single character in the string is a palindrome of length 1, so fill the diagonal of `dp` with 1s.
4: Use a loop to iterate over all possible lengths of substrings from 2 to `n`.
5: For each length, use another loop to iterate over all possible starting indices of the substrings.
6: For each starting index and length, calculate the ending index.
7: If the characters at the starting and ending indices are the same and the length is 2, then the substring is a palindrome of length 2.
8: If the characters at the starting and ending indices are the same and the length is more than 2, then the length of the LPS is 2 plus the value of `dp[start+1][end-1]`.
9: If the characters at the starting and ending indices are different, then the LPS is the maximum of the LPS excluding the starting character or the ending character.
10: After filling the `dp` array, the value at `dp[0][n-1]` will contain the length of the longest palindromic subsequence.
11: To reconstruct the LPS, use the `dp` array and the original string.
12: Return the longest palindromic subsequence.
