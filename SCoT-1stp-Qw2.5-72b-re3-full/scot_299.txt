1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `max_aggregate_sum` to store the maximum sum of integers found so far. Initialize it to 0.
   - `max_aggregate_string` to store the string associated with the maximum sum. Initialize it to an empty string.
   - `aggregate_dict` to store the sum of integers for each unique string. Initialize it as an empty dictionary.

2. **Iterate Through the List of Tuples:**
   - For each tuple `(string, integer)` in the list:
     - If the string is not already in `aggregate_dict`, add it with the integer as its value.
     - If the string is already in `aggregate_dict`, add the integer to the existing value.

3. **Find the Maximum Aggregate:**
   - Iterate through the `aggregate_dict` to find the string with the maximum sum.
   - Update `max_aggregate_sum` and `max_aggregate_string` accordingly.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the string with the maximum aggregate sum.
