Input: test_list: a list of tuples
Output: a dictionary where the keys are the unique elements from the tuples and the values are the counts of how many times each element occurs in the list of tuples

1: Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts of each element
2: Loop through each tuple in the test_list
3:     For each element in the tuple:
4:         If the element is already a key in the dictionary:
5:             Increment the count of that element by 1
6:         Else:
7:             Add the element to the dictionary with a count of 1
8: Return the dictionary containing the counts of each element
