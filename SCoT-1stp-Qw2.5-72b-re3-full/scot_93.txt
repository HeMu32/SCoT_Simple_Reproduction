Input: a: a number (base), b: a number (exponent)
Output: the result of a raised to the power of b

1: If b is 0, return 1 (any number to the power of 0 is 1)
2: If b is negative, return the reciprocal of a raised to the absolute value of b
3: Initialize result to 1
4: for i from 1 to b inclusive:
5:     result = result * a
6: return result
