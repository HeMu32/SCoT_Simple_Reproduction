Input: list1: a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers.
Output: max_sum: an integer representing the maximum sum of elements from any of the sublists.

1: Initialize a variable `max_sum` to store the maximum sum found, set it to the smallest possible integer value.
2: Loop through each sublist in `list1`.
3:     Calculate the sum of the current sublist.
4:     If the sum of the current sublist is greater than `max_sum`, update `max_sum` with the sum of the current sublist.
5: After the loop, return `max_sum`.
