Input: n: an integer representing the number of terms in the series
Output: The sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers

1: Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to store the cumulative sum of cubes.
2: For each number i from 1 to n (inclusive):
3:     Calculate the cube of i (i.e., i^3).
4:     Add the cube of i to `sum`.
5: After the loop, return the value of `sum`.

### Explanation:
The function `sum_Of_Series(n)` calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers. The process involves initializing a variable `sum` to 0, which will store the cumulative sum of the cubes. A for loop is then used to iterate through each number from 1 to `n`. For each number `i`, the cube of `i` is calculated using `i ** 3` and added to `sum`. After the loop completes, the final value of `sum` is returned, which represents the sum of the cubes of the first `n` natural numbers.
