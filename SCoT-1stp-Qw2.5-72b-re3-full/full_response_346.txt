### Explanation

The Entringer numbers, also known as the Euler zigzag numbers, are a sequence of numbers that appear in the study of alternating permutations. The function `zigzag(n, k)` computes the Entringer number E(n, k) using a recursive approach.

- **Base Cases**:
  - If `n` or `k` is less than 0, the function returns 0, as these are invalid indices.
  - If `n` or `k` is 0, the function returns 1, as the first row and column of the Entringer number table are all 1s.

- **Recursive Calculation**:
  - The function iterates from 0 to `k` and recursively calculates the sum of the Entringer numbers for the previous row and the current column, and the current row and the previous column. This is based on the recurrence relation for the Entringer numbers:
    \[
    E(n, k) = \sum_{i=0}^{k} \left( E(n-1, i) + E(n, i-1) \right)
    \]

This recursive approach ensures that the function correctly computes the Entringer number for any valid `n` and `k`. However, it is worth noting that this approach can be inefficient for large values of `n` and `k` due to the repeated calculations. For better performance, dynamic programming or memoization techniques can be used to store and reuse previously computed values.
