[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer
Output: max_sum: the maximum sum obtained by dividing the number into three parts recursively and summing them up

1: If n is less than or equal to 0, return 0 (base case)
2: Initialize max_sum to 0
3: For each division of n into three parts (i, j, k) where i + j + k = n and i, j, k > 0:
4:     Calculate the sum of the recursive calls for i, j, and k
5:     If the calculated sum is greater than max_sum, update max_sum
6: Return max_sum
[END PROCESS]

However, the above process is inefficient because it involves a lot of redundant calculations. A more efficient approach is to use dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems and avoid recalculating them.

1: If n is less than or equal to 0, return 0 (base case)

7:         If the division is valid (i.e., the index is non-negative):

### Explanation:
- **Base Case**: If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the maximum sum is 0.
- **Dynamic Programming Array (`dp`)**: We use a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum we can get by breaking the number `i` into three parts.
- **Filling the DP Array**: For each number `i` from 1 to `n`, we consider all possible ways to break `i` into three parts (i.e., `i-1`, `i-2`, `i-3`). For each valid division, we calculate the sum of the current part and the maximum sum of the remaining part (stored in `dp[j]`), and update `max_sum` if the new sum is greater.
- **Result**: The final result is stored in `dp[n]`, which gives the maximum sum for the number `n`.

This approach ensures that we avoid redundant calculations and efficiently compute the maximum sum using dynamic programming.
