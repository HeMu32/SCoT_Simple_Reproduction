Input: radius: an integer representing the radius of the circle.
Output: count: the number of rectangles that can fit inside a circle of the given radius.

1: Initialize count to 0.
2: For each possible width (w) from 1 to the radius:
3:     For each possible height (h) from 1 to the radius:
4:         Calculate the diagonal of the rectangle using the Pythagorean theorem: d = sqrt(w^2 + h^2).
5:         If the diagonal is less than or equal to the radius:
6:             Increment count by 1.
7: Return count.
