[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: l: a float representing the length of the rectangle, b: a float representing the breadth of the rectangle
Output: area: a float representing the area of the rectangle

1: Check if both l and b are positive numbers
2:     If not, return -1 indicating an invalid input
3: Calculate the area by multiplying l and b
4: Return the area

[BEGIN CODE]
def rectangle_area(l, b):
    # Check if the inputs are valid (positive numbers)
    if l <= 0 or b <= 0:
        return -1  # Return -1 if either length or breadth is not positive
    
    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    area = l * b
    
    # Return the calculated area
    return area

### Explanation:
The function `rectangle_area` is designed to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length (`l`) and breadth (`b`). The process involves the following steps:

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if both the length and breadth are positive numbers. If either of them is not positive, the function returns `-1` to indicate an invalid input.
2. **Area Calculation**: If the inputs are valid, the function calculates the area by multiplying the length and breadth.
3. **Return the Result**: Finally, the function returns the calculated area.

This approach ensures that the function handles invalid inputs gracefully and provides the correct area for valid inputs.
