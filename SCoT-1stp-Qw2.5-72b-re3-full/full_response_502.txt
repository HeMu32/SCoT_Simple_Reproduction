### Explanation:
The function `find(n, m)` is designed to compute the remainder of the division of `n` by `m`. This is a straightforward operation in Python, which can be achieved using the modulus operator `%`. The modulus operator returns the remainder of the division of the first operand by the second. The result is then returned by the function.

For example:
- If `n = 10` and `m = 3`, the function will return `1` because 10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.
- If `n = 15` and `m = 5`, the function will return `0` because 15 is exactly divisible by 5, leaving no remainder.
