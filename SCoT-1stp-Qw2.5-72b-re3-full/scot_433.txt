Input: arr: a list of integers, number: an integer
Output: result: a boolean indicating whether the number is greater than all elements in the array

1: Initialize a variable `result` to True (assuming initially that the number is greater than all elements)
2: Iterate through each element in the array `arr`
3:   If the current element is greater than or equal to the `number`:
4:     Set `result` to False (the number is not greater than all elements)
5:     Break the loop (no need to check further elements)
6: Return the value of `result`
