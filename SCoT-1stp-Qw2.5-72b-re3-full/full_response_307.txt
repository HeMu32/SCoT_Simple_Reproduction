### Explanation:
The function `colon_tuplex` takes three parameters: `tuplex` (the original tuple), `m` (the start index), and `n` (the end index). The function returns a new tuple that is a slice of the original tuple from index `m` to `n` (exclusive).

1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if the indices `m` and `n` are within the valid range. Specifically, it ensures that `m` is not negative, `n` does not exceed the length of the tuple, and `m` is less than `n`. If any of these conditions are not met, the function returns an error message.

2. **Slicing the Tuple**: If the indices are valid, the function slices the tuple using Python's slicing syntax `tuplex[m:n]`, which creates a new tuple containing elements from index `m` to `n-1`.

3. **Return the Result**: The function then returns the sliced tuple.

This approach ensures that the function handles invalid input gracefully and provides the correct output when the input is valid.
