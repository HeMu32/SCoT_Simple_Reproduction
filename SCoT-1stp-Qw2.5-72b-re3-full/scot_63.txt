Input: test_list: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers
Output: max_diff: the maximum difference between the two integers in any of the tuples

1: Initialize max_diff to 0
2: For each tuple (a, b) in test_list:
3:     Calculate the absolute difference between a and b and store it in diff
4:     If diff is greater than max_diff:
5:         Set max_diff to diff
6: Return max_diff
