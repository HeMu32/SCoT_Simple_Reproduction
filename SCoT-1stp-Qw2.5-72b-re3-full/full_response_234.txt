Input: l: a float or integer representing the length of one side of the cube.
Output: volume: a float or integer representing the volume of the cube.

1: Calculate the volume of the cube using the formula `volume = l * l * l`.
2: Return the calculated volume.

### Explanation:
The function `volume_cube` takes a single parameter `l`, which represents the length of one side of the cube. The volume of a cube is calculated using the formula \( \text{volume} = l^3 \). This is a straightforward calculation that involves multiplying the length of one side by itself three times. The result is then returned as the volume of the cube. This function assumes that the input `l` is a valid positive number (float or integer).
