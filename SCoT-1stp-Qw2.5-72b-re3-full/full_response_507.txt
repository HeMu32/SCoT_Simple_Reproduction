[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list1: a list of words, removewords: a list of words to be removed from list1
Output: result: the list1 with the words in removewords removed

1: Initialize an empty list called result
2: For each word in list1:
3:     If the word is not in removewords:
4:         Append the word to result
5: Return result
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def remove_words(list1, removewords):
    result = []
    for word in list1:
        if word not in removewords:
            result.append(word)
    return result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `remove_words` takes two lists as input: `list1`, which is the list from which words will be removed, and `removewords`, which contains the words to be removed from `list1`. The function iterates over each word in `list1` and checks if the word is not in `removewords`. If the word is not in `removewords`, it is appended to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the `result` list, which contains the words from `list1` with the specified words removed. This approach ensures that the function efficiently filters out the unwanted words while preserving the order of the remaining words in the list.
