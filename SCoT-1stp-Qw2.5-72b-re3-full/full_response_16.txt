[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: text: a string from which we need to find sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore
Output: matches: a list of all sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore found in the text

1: Import the regular expression module (re)
2: Define a regular expression pattern that matches sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore
3: Use the re.findall() function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the input text
4: Return the list of matches
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
import re

def text_lowercase_underscore(text):
    # Define the pattern to match sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore
    pattern = r'\b[a-z]+_[a-z]+\b'
    # Find all occurrences of the pattern
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
    # Return the list of matches
    return matches
[END CODE]

Explanation:
- The function `text_lowercase_underscore` takes a string `text` as input.
- The regular expression pattern `\b[a-z]+_[a-z]+\b` is used to match sequences of lowercase letters joined with an underscore. Here, `\b` ensures that the match is a whole word, `[a-z]+` matches one or more lowercase letters, and the underscore `_` is the literal character that joins two sequences of lowercase letters.
- The `re.findall()` function is used to find all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string `text`.
- The function returns a list of all matches found in the input text. If no matches are found, an empty list is returned.
