Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: nums: the list of integers sorted in ascending order

1: Define a function `comb_sort(nums)` that takes a list of integers as input.
2: Initialize the gap to the length of the list and a shrink factor to 1.3.
3: Set a flag `swapped` to True to enter the while loop.
4: While the gap is greater than 1 or `swapped` is True:
5:     Update the gap by dividing it by the shrink factor and taking the floor value.
6:     If the gap is less than 1, set it to 1 to ensure at least one comparison is made.
7:     Set `swapped` to False to prepare for the next iteration.
8:     For each index i from 0 to the length of the list minus the gap:
9:         If the element at index i is greater than the element at index i + gap:
10:            Swap the elements at indices i and i + gap.
11:            Set `swapped` to True to indicate a swap has occurred.
12: Return the sorted list.
