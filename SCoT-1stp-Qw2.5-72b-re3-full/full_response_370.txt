Input: price: a tuple containing elements of various types, including at least one float.
Output: sorted_tuple: a tuple sorted by its float elements.

1: Convert the tuple to a list to enable sorting.
2: Define a key function that extracts the float value from each element.
3: Use the sorted function with the key function to sort the list by the float values.
4: Convert the sorted list back to a tuple.
5: Return the sorted tuple.

### Explanation:
The function `float_sort` is designed to sort a tuple based on its float elements. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Conversion to List**: Tuples are immutable, so we first convert the tuple to a list to allow for sorting.
2. **Key Function**: We define a key function `extract_float` that checks if an element is a float. If it is, it returns the float value. If not, it returns a very high value (`float('inf')`) to ensure non-float elements are sorted to the end.
3. **Sorting**: We use the `sorted` function with the key function to sort the list. The `sorted` function sorts the elements based on the values returned by the key function.
4. **Conversion Back to Tuple**: After sorting, we convert the list back to a tuple.
5. **Return**: Finally, we return the sorted tuple.

This approach ensures that the tuple is sorted by its float elements while keeping non-float elements at the end.
