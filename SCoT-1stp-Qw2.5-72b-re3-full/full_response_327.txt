[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: x, y, z: three integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle
Output: A string indicating whether the triangle is isosceles or not

1: Check if any two sides of the triangle are equal
2: If two sides are equal, then the triangle is isosceles
3: If no two sides are equal, then the triangle is not isosceles
4: Return the appropriate message based on the check
[END PROCESS]

def check_isosceles(x, y, z):
    # Check if any two sides of the triangle are equal
    if x == y or y == z or x == z:
        return "The triangle is isosceles."
    else:
        return "The triangle is not isosceles."
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `check_isosceles` takes three parameters, `x`, `y`, and `z`, which represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The function checks if any two sides are equal using a simple if-else statement. If any two sides are equal, it returns a message stating that the triangle is isosceles. If no two sides are equal, it returns a message stating that the triangle is not isosceles. This approach uses a branch (if-else) to determine the type of triangle based on the side lengths.
