Input: n: an integer
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the given number can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2

1: Initialize a variable `result` to True
2: While `n` is greater than 0:
3:     If `n` is odd:
4:         Set `result` to False
5:         Break the loop
6:     Otherwise:
7:         Subtract the largest power of 2 less than or equal to `n` from `n`
8: Return `result`

Explanation:
- A number can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2 if and only if it is a sum of distinct powers of 2. This is equivalent to the number being a sum of distinct bits in its binary representation.
- If a number is odd, it means it has a '1' in the least significant bit, which cannot be represented as a sum of non-zero powers of 2 (since the smallest non-zero power of 2 is 2^1 = 2).
- If a number is even, we can subtract the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the number and continue checking the remainder.
- If we can reduce the number to 0 by repeatedly subtracting powers of 2, then the number can be represented as the sum of non-zero powers of 2.
