Input: units: an integer representing the number of units consumed.
Output: A float representing the total electricity bill.

1: Define the rate slabs and their corresponding rates.
2: Initialize a variable total_bill to 0.
3: If units are less than or equal to the first slab limit:
4:     Calculate the bill for the first slab and return it.
5: Else if units are less than or equal to the second slab limit:
6:     Calculate the bill for the first slab and the remaining units in the second slab.
7:     Add the two amounts to total_bill and return it.
8: Else if units are less than or equal to the third slab limit:
9:     Calculate the bill for the first, second, and the remaining units in the third slab.
10:    Add the three amounts to total_bill and return it.
11: Else:
12:    Calculate the bill for the first, second, third slabs, and the remaining units at the highest rate.
13:    Add the four amounts to total_bill and return it.
