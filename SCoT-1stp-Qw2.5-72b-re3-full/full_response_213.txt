### Explanation:
The function `concatenate_strings` takes two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, as input. Each tuple contains strings. The function concatenates corresponding strings from each tuple and returns a new tuple containing the concatenated strings.

1. **Initialization**: An empty list `concatenated_list` is initialized to store the concatenated strings.
2. **Looping and Concatenation**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate over pairs of strings from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` using the `zip` function. For each pair, the strings are concatenated and appended to `concatenated_list`.
3. **Conversion to Tuple**: After the loop, the list `concatenated_list` is converted back to a tuple `concatenated_tuple`.
4. **Return**: The function returns the tuple `concatenated_tuple`.

This approach ensures that the function handles tuples of equal length and concatenates corresponding elements efficiently. If the tuples have different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, which is a behavior that should be considered in the context of the problem's requirements.
