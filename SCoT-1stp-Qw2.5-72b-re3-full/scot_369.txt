Input: l (length), w (width), h (height) - all are positive integers or floats representing the dimensions of the cuboid.
Output: The lateral surface area of the cuboid, which is a float or integer.

1: Calculate the perimeter of the base of the cuboid, which is 2 * (l + w).
2: Multiply the perimeter by the height (h) to get the lateral surface area.
3: Return the calculated lateral surface area.
