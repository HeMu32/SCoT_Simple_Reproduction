Input: s: a string
Output: count: an integer representing the number of substrings where the first and last characters are the same

1: Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the number of valid substrings.
2: Iterate over each character in the string using an outer loop with index i.
3: For each character at index i, start an inner loop from i to the end of the string with index j.
4: Extract the substring from index i to j.
5: Check if the first and last characters of the substring are the same.
6: If they are the same, increment count by 1.
7: After the loops complete, return the count.
