[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: a: the side length of a regular pentagon
Output: area: the area of the pentagon

1: Define the formula for the area of a regular pentagon, which is (1/4) * sqrt(5 * (5 + 2 * sqrt(5))) * a^2.
2: Calculate the area using the formula.
3: Return the calculated area.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
import math

def area_pentagon(a):
    # Calculate the area using the formula for a regular pentagon
    area = (1/4) * math.sqrt(5 * (5 + 2 * math.sqrt(5))) * a**2
    return area
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `area_pentagon(a)` calculates the area of a regular pentagon given the side length `a`. The formula used is derived from the geometric properties of a regular pentagon and is given by:

\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{5(5 + 2\sqrt{5})} \times a^2 \]

This formula is implemented in the function using Python's `math.sqrt` function to handle the square root calculations. The result is then returned as the area of the pentagon.
