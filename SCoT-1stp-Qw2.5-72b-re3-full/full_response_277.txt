[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: dict: a dictionary with integer values, n: an integer
Output: filtered_dict: a dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to n

1: Initialize an empty dictionary called filtered_dict
2: For each key-value pair (key, value) in dict:
3:     If value is greater than or equal to n:
4:         Add the key-value pair to filtered_dict
5: Return filtered_dict
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def dict_filter(dict, n):
    filtered_dict = {key: value for key, value in dict.items() if value >= n}
    return filtered_dict
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `dict_filter` takes two parameters: `dict`, which is the dictionary to be filtered, and `n`, which is the threshold value. The function returns a new dictionary, `filtered_dict`, which contains only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

The process involves:
- Initializing an empty dictionary `filtered_dict`.
- Iterating over each key-value pair in the input dictionary `dict`.
- Using a conditional statement to check if the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
- If the condition is true, the key-value pair is added to `filtered_dict`.
- Finally, the function returns `filtered_dict`.

This approach uses a dictionary comprehension for a concise and efficient implementation.
