### Explanation:
The function `max_volume(s)` is designed to find the maximum volume of a cuboid given the sum of its sides. The sides of the cuboid are represented by `i`, `j`, and `k`, where `i` is the length, `j` is the width, and `k` is the height. The sum of these sides is given by `s`.

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `max_volume` to 0. This variable will store the maximum volume found during the iterations.

2. **Nested Loops**: We use two nested loops to iterate over possible values of `i` and `j`. The outer loop iterates over possible values of `i` from 1 to `s-2` (inclusive), and the inner loop iterates over possible values of `j` from 1 to `s-i-1` (inclusive). The value of `k` is then determined as `s - i - j`.

3. **Volume Calculation**: For each combination of `i`, `j`, and `k`, we calculate the volume of the cuboid as `i * j * k`.

4. **Update Maximum Volume**: If the calculated volume is greater than the current `max_volume`, we update `max_volume` to the new value.

5. **Return Result**: After all possible combinations have been checked, we return the maximum volume found.

This approach ensures that we explore all possible combinations of side lengths that sum up to `s`, and we find the combination that yields the maximum volume.
