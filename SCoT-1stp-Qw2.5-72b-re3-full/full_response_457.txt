Input: lst: a list of sublists  
Output: The sublist with the minimum length  
1: Initialize a variable `min_length` with a large number (like infinity) to keep track of the minimum length found so far  
2: Initialize a variable `min_sublist` to store the sublist with the minimum length  
3: Iterate through each sublist in the input list `lst`:  
4:     If the length of the current sublist is less than `min_length`:  
5:         Update `min_length` to the length of the current sublist  
6:         Update `min_sublist` to the current sublist  
7: Return `min_sublist`

### Explanation:
The function `Find_Min` is designed to find and return the sublist from a list of sublists that has the minimum length. The process involves initializing a variable `min_length` with a very large value (infinity) and a variable `min_sublist` to store the sublist with the minimum length. The function then iterates through each sublist in the input list, comparing the length of each sublist to the current minimum length. If a shorter sublist is found, the `min_length` and `min_sublist` variables are updated accordingly. Finally, the function returns the sublist with the minimum length. This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies and returns the shortest sublist in the input list.
