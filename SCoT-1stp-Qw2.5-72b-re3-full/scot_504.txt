Input: n: an integer representing the number of terms in the series
Output: The sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers

1: Initialize a variable `sum` to 0 to store the cumulative sum of cubes.
2: For each number i from 1 to n (inclusive):
3:     Calculate the cube of i (i.e., i^3).
4:     Add the cube of i to `sum`.
5: After the loop, return the value of `sum`.
