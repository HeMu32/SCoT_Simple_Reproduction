[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer representing the number of first even natural numbers to consider.
Output: sum: an integer representing the sum of the fifth power of the first n even natural numbers.

1: Initialize a variable sum to 0 to store the cumulative sum.
2: Loop through each integer i from 1 to n inclusive.
3:     Calculate the even number as 2 * i.
4:     Calculate the fifth power of the even number.
5:     Add the fifth power to the sum.
6: After the loop, return the sum.

### Explanation:
The function `even_Power_Sum` calculates the sum of the fifth powers of the first `n` even natural numbers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing a variable `sum` to 0. This variable will hold the cumulative sum of the fifth powers of the even numbers.

2. **Loop Through Even Numbers**: We use a for loop to iterate from 1 to `n` inclusive. For each iteration:
   - We calculate the even number as `2 * i`.
   - We compute the fifth power of this even number using the exponentiation operator `**`.
   - We add this fifth power to the `sum`.

3. **Return the Result**: After the loop completes, the `sum` variable contains the total sum of the fifth powers of the first `n` even natural numbers. We return this value.

This approach ensures that we correctly compute the sum of the fifth powers of the first `n` even natural numbers in an efficient and straightforward manner.
