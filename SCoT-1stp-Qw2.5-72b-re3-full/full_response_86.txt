Explanation:
A centered hexagonal number, also known as a hex number, is a centered figurate number that represents a hexagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in a hexagonal lattice. The formula to find the nth centered hexagonal number is given by \( H_n = 3n(n - 1) + 1 \). This formula is derived from the geometric arrangement of points in a hexagonal pattern. The function `centered_hexagonal_number` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the nth centered hexagonal number by applying the formula. The calculation is straightforward and involves a simple arithmetic operation.
