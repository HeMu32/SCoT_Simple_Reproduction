Input: n: an integer  
Output: msb: the most significant bit number which is set in the binary representation of n  
1: Initialize msb to 0  
2: Initialize a variable `bit_position` to 0  
3: While n is greater than 0:  
4:     If the least significant bit of n is 1:  
5:         Set msb to 2 raised to the power of `bit_position`  
6:     Right shift n by 1 bit  
7:     Increment `bit_position` by 1  
8: Return msb
