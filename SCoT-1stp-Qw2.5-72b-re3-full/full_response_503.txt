[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: result: a list of integers where each element is the sum of consecutive numbers from the input list

1: Initialize an empty list result
2: For each index i in the range from 0 to the length of nums - 1:
3:     If i is less than the length of nums - 1 (to ensure there is a next element):
4:         Add nums[i] and nums[i+1] and append the sum to result
5: Return result

Explanation:
The function `add_consecutive_nums` takes a list of integers `nums` as input. It initializes an empty list `result` to store the sums of consecutive numbers. The function then iterates over the indices of the input list, except for the last index, to ensure that there is always a next element to add. For each index `i`, it calculates the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]` and appends this sum to the `result` list. Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing the sums of consecutive numbers from the input list.
