[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list1: a list containing various types of elements
Output: count: the number of integer elements in the list

1: Initialize a variable count to 0 to keep track of the number of integers
2: Loop through each element in the list list1
3:     Check if the current element is an instance of the int type
4:     If it is, increment the count by 1
5: After the loop, return the count
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def count_integer(list1):
    count = 0
    for element in list1:
        if isinstance(element, int):
            count += 1
    return count
[END CODE]

Explanation:
- The function `count_integer` takes a single argument, `list1`, which is expected to be a list containing various types of elements.
- A variable `count` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to keep track of the number of integer elements in the list.
- The function then iterates over each element in the list using a for loop.
- Inside the loop, the function checks if the current element is an instance of the `int` type using the `isinstance` function.
- If the element is an integer, the `count` variable is incremented by 1.
- After the loop has completed, the function returns the `count` variable, which now contains the total number of integer elements in the list.
