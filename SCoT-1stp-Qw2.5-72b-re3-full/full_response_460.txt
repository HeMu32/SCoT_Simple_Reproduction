[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: lst: a list of sublists
Output: A list containing the first element of each sublist

1: Initialize an empty list result
2: Loop through each sublist in lst
3:     For each sublist, extract the first element
4:     Append the first element to result
5: Return the result list
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def Extract(lst):
    result = []
    for sublist in lst:
        if sublist:  # Check if the sublist is not empty
            result.append(sublist[0])
    return result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `Extract` is designed to take a list of sublists (`lst`) as input and return a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The process involves:
- Initializing an empty list `result` to store the first elements.
- Iterating over each sublist in the input list `lst`.
- For each sublist, checking if it is not empty to avoid an `IndexError`.
- If the sublist is not empty, appending the first element of the sublist to the `result` list.
- Finally, returning the `result` list.

This approach ensures that the function handles cases where sublists might be empty, preventing runtime errors.
