Input: Input: a list of tuples, k: an integer (though k is not used in this function, it's included in the function signature)
Output: A boolean value indicating whether all tuples in the list have the same length

1: Initialize a variable `first_length` to store the length of the first tuple in the list
2: Initialize a boolean variable `all_equal` to True
3: For each tuple `tup` in the list:
4:     If the length of `tup` is not equal to `first_length`:
5:         Set `all_equal` to False
6:         Break the loop
7: Return `all_equal`

### Explanation:
The function `get_equal` checks if all tuples in the provided list `Input` have the same length. The function starts by checking if the list is empty, in which case it returns `True` because an empty list trivially satisfies the condition of having tuples of equal length. It then initializes `first_length` with the length of the first tuple in the list. A boolean variable `all_equal` is set to `True` initially, assuming all tuples are of equal length. The function then iterates through each tuple in the list, and if it finds a tuple whose length is not equal to `first_length`, it sets `all_equal` to `False` and breaks out of the loop. Finally, the function returns the value of `all_equal`.
