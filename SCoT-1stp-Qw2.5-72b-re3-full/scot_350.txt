Input: s: a string
Output: min_length: the minimum length of the string after removing all occurrences of any one character

1: Initialize min_length to the length of the string s
2: for each unique character c in s:
3:     Create a new string s_new by removing all occurrences of c from s
4:     if the length of s_new is less than min_length:
5:         Update min_length to the length of s_new
6: return min_length
