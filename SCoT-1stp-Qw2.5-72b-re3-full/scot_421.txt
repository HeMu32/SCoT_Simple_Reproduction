Input: test_tup: a tuple containing elements that can be converted to strings
Output: result: a single string where each element of the tuple is concatenated with a delimiter (a space by default)

1: Initialize an empty string `result`
2: Loop through each element in `test_tup`
3:     Convert the current element to a string
4:     If the `result` is still empty (i.e., this is the first element):
5:         Append the string representation of the current element to `result`
6:     Else:
7:         Append a delimiter (space) followed by the string representation of the current element to `result`
8: Return `result`
