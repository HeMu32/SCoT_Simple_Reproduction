[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list1: a list of lists, where each sublist contains integers.
Output: max_sum: an integer representing the maximum sum of elements from any of the sublists.

1: Initialize a variable `max_sum` to store the maximum sum found, set it to the smallest possible integer value.
2: Loop through each sublist in `list1`.
3:     Calculate the sum of the current sublist.
4:     If the sum of the current sublist is greater than `max_sum`, update `max_sum` with the sum of the current sublist.
5: After the loop, return `max_sum`.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def maximum_Sum(list1):
    max_sum = float('-inf')  # Initialize max_sum to negative infinity
    for sublist in list1:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)  # Calculate the sum of the current sublist
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum  # Update max_sum if the current_sum is greater
    return max_sum
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: We start by initializing `max_sum` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This ensures that any sum of a sublist will be larger than the initial value, allowing us to correctly update `max_sum` as we iterate through the sublists.
- **Looping through Sublists**: We use a for loop to iterate through each sublist in `list1`.
- **Sum Calculation**: For each sublist, we calculate the sum of its elements using the `sum()` function.
- **Comparison and Update**: We compare the sum of the current sublist with `max_sum`. If the current sum is greater, we update `max_sum` with this new value.
- **Return the Result**: After the loop completes, `max_sum` will contain the maximum sum of elements from any of the sublists, which we then return.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum sum by only iterating through the list once, making it an O(n) solution where n is the total number of elements in all sublists combined.
