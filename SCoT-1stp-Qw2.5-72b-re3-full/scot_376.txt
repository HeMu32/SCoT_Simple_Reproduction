Output: res: a tuple with elements that occur more than once replaced by a custom value (e.g., 'custom_value')

1: Initialize an empty list res
2: Initialize an empty dictionary count_dict to keep track of the count of each element
3: For each element in test_tup:
4:     If the element is not in count_dict:
5:         Add the element to count_dict with a count of 1
6:     Else:
7:         Increment the count of the element in count_dict by 1
8: For each element in test_tup:
9:     If the count of the element in count_dict is 1:
10:        Append the element to res
11:    Else:
12:        Append 'custom_value' to res
13: Convert res to a tuple
14: Return res
