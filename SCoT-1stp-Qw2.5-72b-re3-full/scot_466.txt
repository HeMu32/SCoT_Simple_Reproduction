Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the array
Output: the index of a peak element in the array

A peak element is an element that is not smaller than its neighbors. For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor.

1: Check if the array is empty or has only one element; if so, return the index of the only element as the peak.
2: Check if the first element is a peak; if so, return 0.
3: Check if the last element is a peak; if so, return n-1.
4: Iterate through the array from the second element to the second last element.
5:     For each element, check if it is greater than or equal to its neighbors.
6:     If it is, return the index of the current element.
7: If no peak is found, return -1 (indicating no peak element was found).
