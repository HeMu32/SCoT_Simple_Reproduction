[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: result: a list of integers containing only the odd numbers from the input list

1: Use the `filter` function to apply a lambda function to each element in the nums list.
2:     The lambda function takes one argument, x, and returns True if x is odd (x % 2 != 0), otherwise False.
3: Convert the filter object to a list.
4: Return the list as the result.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def filter_oddnumbers(nums):
    result = filter(lambda x: x % 2 != 0, nums)
    return list(result)
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `filter_oddnumbers` is designed to filter out odd numbers from a given list of integers. The `filter` function in Python is used to construct an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true. In this case, the function is a lambda function that checks if a number is odd by using the modulus operator (`%`). If the number modulo 2 is not equal to 0, the number is odd, and the lambda function returns `True`, allowing the number to pass through the filter. The result of the `filter` function is then converted to a list and returned.
