[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: An array of integers
Output: The largest palindromic number in the array

1: Initialize a variable `max_palindrome` to None, which will store the largest palindrome found.
2: Iterate through each element in the array.
3: For each element:
4:     Convert the element to a string.
5:     Check if the string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
6:     If it is a palindrome and either `max_palindrome` is None or the current element is greater than `max_palindrome`, update `max_palindrome` with the current element.
7: After the loop, if `max_palindrome` is still None, return a message indicating no palindromic number was found.
8: Otherwise, return `max_palindrome`.
[END PROCESS]

        str_num = str(num)

            if max_palindrome is None or num > max_palindrome:
                max_palindrome = num
    if max_palindrome is None:
        return "No palindromic number found in the array."

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**: We start by initializing `max_palindrome` to `None`. This variable will keep track of the largest palindromic number found in the array.
- **Iteration**: We iterate through each element in the array using a for loop.
- **Palindrome Check**: For each element, we convert it to a string and check if it is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`str_num == str_num[::-1]`).
- **Update `max_palindrome`**: If the current element is a palindrome and is greater than the current `max_palindrome`, we update `max_palindrome` with the current element.
- **Final Check**: After the loop, if `max_palindrome` is still `None`, it means no palindromic number was found in the array, so we return a message indicating this. Otherwise, we return the largest palindromic number found.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the largest palindromic number in the array, and it handles cases where no palindromic numbers are present.
