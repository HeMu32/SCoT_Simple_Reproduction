[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: a, b, c: three numbers (integers or floats)
Output: The median of the three numbers

1: Sort the three numbers in ascending order.
2: Return the middle number from the sorted list.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def median_numbers(a, b, c):
    # Create a list of the three numbers
    numbers = [a, b, c]
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    # The median is the middle number in the sorted list
    return numbers[1]
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `median_numbers` takes three numbers as input and returns the median of these numbers. The process involves:
1. Creating a list containing the three input numbers.
2. Sorting the list in ascending order. In Python, the `sort()` method sorts the list in place.
3. Returning the middle element of the sorted list, which is the median of the three numbers. Since the list is sorted, the element at index 1 (the second element) is the median.

This approach is straightforward and leverages Python's built-in list sorting capabilities to find the median efficiently.
