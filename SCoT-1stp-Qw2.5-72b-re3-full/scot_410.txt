Input: listval: a list containing heterogeneous elements (integers, floats, strings, etc.)
Output: min_value: the minimum numeric value in the list

1: Initialize a variable min_value to None, which will store the minimum value found
2: Loop through each element in listval:
3:     If the element is a numeric type (int or float):
4:         If min_value is None or the element is less than min_value:
5:             Set min_value to the element
6: If min_value is still None after the loop, raise an error indicating no numeric values were found
7: Return min_value
