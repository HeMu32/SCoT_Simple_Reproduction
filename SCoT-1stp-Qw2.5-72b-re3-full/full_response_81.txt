[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two tuples of elements
Output: result: a list of tuples where each tuple contains elements from the corresponding positions of test_tup1 and test_tup2

1: Use the `zip` function to combine the two tuples into a list of tuples.
2: Convert the zip object to a list.
3: Return the list as the result.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def zip_tuples(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    result = zip(test_tup1, test_tup2)
    return list(result)
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `zip_tuples` takes two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, as input. The `zip` function is used to pair elements from these two tuples at the same index positions, creating a list of tuples. Each tuple in the resulting list contains one element from `test_tup1` and one from `test_tup2`. The `zip` function returns a zip object, which is then converted to a list using the `list` function before being returned. This approach is efficient and leverages Python's built-in functions to achieve the desired result.
