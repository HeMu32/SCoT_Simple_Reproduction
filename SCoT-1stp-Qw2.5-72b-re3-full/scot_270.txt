Input: arr: a list of integers, n: an integer representing the length of the list
Output: sum: an integer representing the sum of even numbers at even positions in the list
1: Initialize sum to 0
2: for each index i from 0 to n-1, incrementing by 2 (to only consider even indices) do
3:     if arr[i] is even then
4:         Add arr[i] to sum
5: return sum
