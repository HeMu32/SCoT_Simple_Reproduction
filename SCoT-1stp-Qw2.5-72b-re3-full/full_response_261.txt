### Explanation:
The function `division_elements` takes two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, as input and performs element-wise division of the elements in `test_tup1` by the corresponding elements in `test_tup2`. The results are stored in a list, which is then converted to a tuple before being returned.

1. **Initialization**: An empty list `result_list` is initialized to store the division results.
2. **Loop through elements**: A `for` loop is used to iterate through the elements of `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` simultaneously using the `zip` function.
3. **Check for division by zero**: Inside the loop, a `if` statement checks if the divisor (`num2`) is zero. If it is, a `ValueError` is raised to indicate that division by zero is not allowed.
4. **Perform division**: If the divisor is not zero, the division of `num1` by `num2` is performed, and the result is appended to `result_list`.
5. **Convert to tuple**: After the loop, `result_list` is converted to a tuple `result_tup`.
6. **Return result**: The function returns `result_tup`.

This approach ensures that the function handles division by zero gracefully and returns the correct results for valid inputs.
