[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: str1: a string from which lowercase substrings are to be removed
Output: result: a string with all lowercase substrings removed

1: Initialize an empty string called `result` to store the final output
2: Loop through each character `ch` in the input string `str1`
3:   If `ch` is not a lowercase letter:
4:     Append `ch` to `result`
5: Return `result` as the final output
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def remove_lowercase(str1):
    result = ""
    for ch in str1:
        if not ch.islower():
            result += ch
    return result
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `remove_lowercase` is designed to remove all lowercase letters from a given string `str1`. The process involves iterating through each character in the string and checking if it is a lowercase letter. If the character is not a lowercase letter, it is appended to the `result` string. Finally, the `result` string, which contains only the non-lowercase characters, is returned. This approach ensures that all lowercase substrings are removed, leaving only uppercase letters, digits, and special characters in the output.
