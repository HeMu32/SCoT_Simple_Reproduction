[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: text: a string of text
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the text contains a word with the letter 'z'

1: Initialize a variable `found` to False, which will be used to indicate if a word containing 'z' is found.
2: Split the input text into a list of words.
3: Loop through each word in the list:
4:     If the word contains the letter 'z':
5:         Set `found` to True
6:         Break the loop
7: After the loop, return the value of `found`.

Explanation:
The function `text_match_wordz` takes a string `text` as input and checks if any word in the text contains the letter 'z'. It initializes a boolean variable `found` to `False` to keep track of whether a word with 'z' has been found. The text is split into a list of words using the `split()` method. The function then iterates over each word in the list. If a word containing 'z' is found, `found` is set to `True` and the loop is exited early using `break`. Finally, the function returns the value of `found`, which will be `True` if a word with 'z' was found, and `False` otherwise.
