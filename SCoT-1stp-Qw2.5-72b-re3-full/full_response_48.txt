[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: n: an integer representing the number whose odd bits are to be set
Output: The integer with all odd bits set to 1

1: Initialize a variable `mask` to 0. This will be used to create a mask with all odd bits set.
2: Initialize a variable `bit_position` to 1. This will be used to determine the current bit position.
3: Loop while `bit_position` is less than or equal to the number of bits in `n`:
   a: If `bit_position` is odd, set the corresponding bit in `mask` to 1.
   b: Increment `bit_position` by 1.
4: Use bitwise OR operation between `n` and `mask` to set all odd bits in `n`.
5: Return the result of the bitwise OR operation.

### Explanation:
- **Mask Creation**: The `mask` is created by setting all the odd bit positions to 1. For example, for a 4-bit number, the odd bit positions are 1 and 3 (0-indexed). So, the mask would be `0101` in binary, which is `5` in decimal.
- **Bit Position**: The `bit_position` variable is used to iterate through the bit positions of the number. It starts at 1 (the first bit) and increments by 1 in each iteration.
- **Bitwise OR**: The final result is obtained by performing a bitwise OR operation between the original number `n` and the `mask`. This operation sets all the odd bits in `n` to 1, while leaving the even bits unchanged.

This approach ensures that all odd bits in the given number are set to 1, and the function returns the modified number.
