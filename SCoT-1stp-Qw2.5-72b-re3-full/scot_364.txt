Input: str: a binary string (string containing only '0's and '1's)
Output: The minimum number of flips required to make the string alternate in characters.

1: Initialize two counters, flip0 and flip1, to 0. These will count the number of flips needed if the string starts with '0' and '1' respectively.
2: Loop through each character in the string:
3:     If the index of the character is even:
4:         If the character is '1', increment flip0 (since we expect '0' at even indices for a string starting with '0').
5:         If the character is '0', increment flip1 (since we expect '1' at even indices for a string starting with '1').
6:     If the index of the character is odd:
7:         If the character is '0', increment flip0 (since we expect '1' at odd indices for a string starting with '0').
8:         If the character is '1', increment flip1 (since we expect '0' at odd indices for a string starting with '1').
9: Return the minimum of flip0 and flip1, as this will be the minimum number of flips required to make the string alternate.
