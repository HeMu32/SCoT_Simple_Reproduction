### Explanation:
The lateral surface area of a cylinder is the area of the side surface, excluding the top and bottom circles. The formula for the lateral surface area of a cylinder is given by \( 2 \pi r h \), where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. The function `lateralsurface_cylinder` takes two parameters, `r` and `h`, and returns the lateral surface area calculated using this formula. The `math` module is imported to use the value of \( \pi \) (pi).
