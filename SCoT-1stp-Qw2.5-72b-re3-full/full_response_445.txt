[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two tuples of integers
Output: result_tup: a tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from test_tup1 and test_tup2

1: Initialize an empty list to store the results of the multiplication.
2: Check if the lengths of the two input tuples are equal.
3: If the lengths are not equal:
4:     Return None (or an error message) as the operation cannot be performed.
5: If the lengths are equal:
6:     Loop through the indices of the tuples.
7:     For each index, multiply the corresponding elements from test_tup1 and test_tup2.
8:     Append the result to the result list.
9: Convert the result list to a tuple.
10: Return the result tuple.

### Explanation:
The function `index_multiplication` takes two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from the input tuples. The function first checks if the lengths of the two input tuples are equal. If they are not, the function returns `None` because the operation cannot be performed. If the lengths are equal, the function iterates over the indices of the tuples, multiplies the corresponding elements, and appends the results to a list. Finally, the list is converted to a tuple and returned. This approach ensures that the function handles the case where the input tuples have different lengths and performs the required element-wise multiplication when the lengths are equal.
