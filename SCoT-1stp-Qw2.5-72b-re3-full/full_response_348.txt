Input: M: an integer representing the length of the sequence
Output: count: the number of sequences of length M with non-negative prefix sums that can be generated by the values -1 and 1

1: Initialize a 2D list dp with dimensions (M+1) x (M+1) to store the number of ways to achieve a certain prefix sum at a certain position in the sequence.
2: Set dp[0][0] to 1, as there is exactly one way to have a prefix sum of 0 with 0 elements.
3: Loop through each position from 1 to M (inclusive) to fill the dp table.
4:     For each possible prefix sum j from 0 to the current position i (inclusive):
5:         If the prefix sum j is greater than 0, add the value of dp[i-1][j-1] to dp[i][j] (this accounts for adding a 1 to the sequence).
6:         If the prefix sum j is less than the current position i, add the value of dp[i-1][j+1] to dp[i][j] (this accounts for adding a -1 to the sequence).
7: The value at dp[M][0] will be the total number of valid sequences of length M.
8: Return dp[M][0] as the result.

### Explanation:
The function `find_ways(M)` calculates the number of sequences of length `M` that can be formed using the values -1 and 1, such that the prefix sum at any point in the sequence is non-negative. This is a dynamic programming problem where we use a 2D list `dp` to store the number of ways to achieve a certain prefix sum at a certain position in the sequence.

- `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to have a prefix sum of `j` after `i` elements.
- The base case is `dp[0][0] = 1`, meaning there is one way to have a prefix sum of 0 with 0 elements (an empty sequence).
- For each position `i` from 1 to `M`, and for each possible prefix sum `j` from 0 to `i`, we update `dp[i][j]` based on the previous values:
  - If `j > 0`, we can add a 1 to the sequence, which means the prefix sum `j` at position `i` can be achieved by adding 1 to a sequence with prefix sum `j-1` at position `i-1`.
  - If `j < i`, we can add a -1 to the sequence, which means the prefix sum `j` at position `i` can be achieved by adding -1 to a sequence with prefix sum `j+1` at position `i-1`.
- The final result is `dp[M][0]`, which gives the number of valid sequences of length `M` that end with a prefix sum of 0.
