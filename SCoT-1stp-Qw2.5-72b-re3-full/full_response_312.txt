Input: r: a float representing the radius of the base of the cone, h: a float representing the height of the cone
Output: volume: a float representing the volume of the cone

1: Define the formula for the volume of a cone, which is (1/3) * π * r^2 * h
2: Calculate the volume using the given radius and height
3: Return the calculated volume

    # Calculate the volume of the cone using the formula
    volume = (1/3) * math.pi * r**2 * h
    return volume
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `volume_cone` takes two parameters, `r` and `h`, which represent the radius of the base and the height of the cone, respectively. The volume of a cone is calculated using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The function uses the `math.pi` constant for the value of π and computes the volume by substituting the given values of `r` and `h` into the formula. Finally, the function returns the calculated volume.
