Input: N: an integer
Output: The next perfect square greater than N

1: Start with the integer N
2: Increment N by 1
3: Loop while N is not a perfect square:
   3.1: Check if the square root of N is an integer (i.e., N is a perfect square)
   3.2: If N is a perfect square, break the loop
   3.3: Otherwise, increment N by 1
4: Return N as the next perfect square
