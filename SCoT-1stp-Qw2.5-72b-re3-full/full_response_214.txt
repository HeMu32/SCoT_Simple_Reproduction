Input: radian: a float representing an angle in radians
Output: degree: a float representing the angle in degrees

1: Define the conversion factor from radians to degrees (180 / π)
2: Multiply the radian value by the conversion factor to get the degree value
3: Return the degree value
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
import math

def degree_radian(radian):
    # Define the conversion factor
    conversion_factor = 180 / math.pi
    
    # Convert radian to degree
    degree = radian * conversion_factor
    
    # Return the degree value
    return degree
[END CODE]

**Explanation:**
The function `degree_radian` takes a single parameter `radian`, which is a float representing an angle in radians. The goal is to convert this angle into degrees. The conversion is done using the formula:

\[ \text{degree} = \text{radian} \times \left( \frac{180}{\pi} \right) \]

Here, `math.pi` is used to get the value of π (pi). The function then returns the calculated degree value. This process involves a simple sequence of operations with no branches or loops, as the conversion is straightforward.
