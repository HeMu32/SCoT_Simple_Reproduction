[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: l (length), w (width), h (height) - all are positive integers or floats representing the dimensions of the cuboid.
Output: The lateral surface area of the cuboid, which is a float or integer.

1: Calculate the perimeter of the base of the cuboid, which is 2 * (l + w).
2: Multiply the perimeter by the height (h) to get the lateral surface area.
3: Return the calculated lateral surface area.

    # Return the lateral surface area

### Explanation:
The lateral surface area of a cuboid is the area of the four sides, excluding the top and bottom faces. The formula to calculate the lateral surface area (LSA) is given by:
\[ \text{LSA} = 2 \times (l + w) \times h \]
where:
- \( l \) is the length of the cuboid,
- \( w \) is the width of the cuboid,
- \( h \) is the height of the cuboid.

The perimeter of the base (which is a rectangle) is \( 2 \times (l + w) \). Multiplying this perimeter by the height \( h \) gives the lateral surface area. This formula is implemented in the function `lateralsurface_cuboid`, which takes the length, width, and height as inputs and returns the lateral surface area.
