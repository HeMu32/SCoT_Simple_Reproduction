Input: n: an integer representing the number of the first natural numbers to consider.
Output: The difference between the squared sum of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.

1: Initialize a variable `sum_of_squares` to 0 to store the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.
2: Initialize a variable `square_of_sum` to 0 to store the square of the sum of the first n natural numbers.
3: Loop from 1 to n (inclusive):
4:     Add the square of the current number to `sum_of_squares`.
5:     Add the current number to `square_of_sum`.
6: After the loop, square the `square_of_sum`.
7: Calculate the difference between `square_of_sum` and `sum_of_squares`.
8: Return the calculated difference.
