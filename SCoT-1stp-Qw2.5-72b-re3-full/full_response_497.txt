### Explanation:
The function `surfacearea_cone` calculates the surface area of a cone given its radius `r` and height `h`. The surface area of a cone is given by the formula:

\[ \text{Surface Area} = \pi r (r + l) \]

where:
- \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone.
- \( l \) is the slant height of the cone, which can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem: \( l = \sqrt{r^2 + h^2} \).

The function first computes the slant height `l` using the given radius `r` and height `h`. Then, it uses this slant height to compute the surface area of the cone. Finally, it returns the calculated surface area.
