Input: x, y: two integers
Output: boolean: True if x and y are co-prime, False otherwise

1: Define a function to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.
2: Use the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD:
   - While y is not 0:
     - Set x to y
     - Set y to the remainder of x divided by y
3: If the GCD is 1, x and y are co-prime, return True.
4: Otherwise, return False.
