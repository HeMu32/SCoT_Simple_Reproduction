[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_tuple: a tuple containing strings
Output: res: a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple

1: Initialize an empty list res to store the results
2: Loop through each string in the test_tuple
3:   For each string, extract the last character
4:   Append the last character to the res list
5: Return the res list
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def extract_rear(test_tuple):
    res = [s[-1] for s in test_tuple]
    return res
[END CODE]

**Explanation:**
- The function `extract_rear` takes a tuple `test_tuple` as input.
- A list comprehension is used to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple.
- For each string, the last character `s[-1]` is extracted and added to the list `res`.
- Finally, the function returns the list `res` containing the last characters of each string in the input tuple. This approach is efficient and concise, leveraging Python's powerful list comprehension feature.
