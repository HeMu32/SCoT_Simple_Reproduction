Input: str1: a string
Output: count: the number of characters in the string that are at the same position in the English alphabet as their index in the string (considering 0-based indexing and 'a' or 'A' as the 0th character)

1: Initialize count to 0
2: Convert the string to lowercase to handle both uppercase and lowercase characters uniformly
3: Loop through each character in the string with its index
4:     Calculate the position of the character in the alphabet (0-based)
5:     If the position matches the index, increment count by 1
6: Return count
