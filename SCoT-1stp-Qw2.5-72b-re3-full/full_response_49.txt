[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: nums: a two-dimensional list, N: an integer representing the index of the element to extract (0-based index)
Output: result: a list containing the first or specified element from each sublist in nums

1: Initialize an empty list called result
2: for each sublist in nums:
3:     if the length of the sublist is greater than N:
4:         append the element at index N of the sublist to result
5:     else:
6:         append None to result (to handle cases where the sublist is too short)
7: return result
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]

    result = []
    for sublist in nums:
        if len(sublist) > N:
            result.append(sublist[N])
        else:

### Explanation

The function `specified_element` is designed to extract a specified element (based on the index `N`) from each sublist within a two-dimensional list `nums`. Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Initialization**: An empty list `result` is initialized to store the extracted elements.
2. **Iteration**: The function iterates over each sublist in `nums`.
3. **Condition Check**: For each sublist, the function checks if the length of the sublist is greater than `N`:
   - If true, it appends the element at index `N` of the sublist to `result`.
   - If false, it appends `None` to `result` to indicate that the sublist is too short to have an element at index `N`.
4. **Return**: Finally, the function returns the `result` list containing the extracted elements or `None` for sublists that are too short.

This approach ensures that the function handles cases where sublists may have different lengths, providing a robust solution to the problem.
