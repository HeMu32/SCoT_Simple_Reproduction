Input: arr: a list of integers, n: an integer representing the length of the list
Output: a list of integers rearranged such that positive and negative numbers alternate, starting with a positive number if possible
1: Initialize two lists, pos and neg, to store positive and negative numbers from arr, respectively
2: Iterate through the elements in arr
3:     If the element is positive, append it to pos
4:     If the element is negative, append it to neg
5: Initialize an empty list, result, to store the rearranged elements
6: Initialize two index variables, i and j, to 0 for tracking the current position in pos and neg lists, respectively
7: While i is less than the length of pos and j is less than the length of neg:
8:     Append the element at index i from pos to result
9:     Increment i by 1
10:     Append the element at index j from neg to result
11:     Increment j by 1
12: If there are remaining elements in pos, append them to result
13: If there are remaining elements in neg, append them to result
14: Return result
