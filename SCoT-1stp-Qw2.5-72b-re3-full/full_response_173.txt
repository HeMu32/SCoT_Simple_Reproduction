[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: text: a string
Output: result: a string containing only alphanumeric characters

1: Initialize an empty string named result to store the filtered characters.
2: For each character ch in the text:
3:     If ch is alphanumeric (using isalnum() method):
4:         Append ch to result.
5: Return result.
[END PROCESS]

def remove_splchar(text):

        if ch.isalnum():
            result += ch
    return result

### Explanation:
The function `remove_splchar` is designed to remove all characters from a given string `text` except for alphanumeric characters (letters and digits). Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the function works:

1. **Initialization**: An empty string `result` is initialized to store the characters that are alphanumeric.
2. **Loop Through Characters**: The function iterates over each character `ch` in the input string `text`.
3. **Check Alphanumeric**: For each character, the function checks if it is alphanumeric using the `isalnum()` method. This method returns `True` if the character is a letter (a-z, A-Z) or a digit (0-9), and `False` otherwise.
4. **Append to Result**: If the character is alphanumeric, it is appended to the `result` string.
5. **Return Result**: After the loop completes, the function returns the `result` string, which contains only the alphanumeric characters from the original input.

This approach ensures that all non-alphanumeric characters are removed from the input string, and only the desired characters are retained.
