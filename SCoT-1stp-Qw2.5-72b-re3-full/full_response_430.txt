### Explanation:
The directrix of a parabola given by the equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) can be found using the vertex form of the parabola equation. The vertex form is \( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \), where \( (h, k) \) is the vertex of the parabola.

1. **Vertex Calculation**:
   - The x-coordinate of the vertex \( h \) is given by \( h = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
   - The y-coordinate of the vertex \( k \) is given by substituting \( h \) back into the original equation: \( k = c - \frac{b^2 - 1}{4a} \).

2. **Directrix Calculation**:
   - The directrix of a parabola is a horizontal line that is equidistant from the vertex as the focus. The y-coordinate of the directrix is given by \( k - \frac{1}{4a} \).

By following these steps, the function `parabola_directrix` calculates and returns the y-coordinate of the directrix of the parabola.
