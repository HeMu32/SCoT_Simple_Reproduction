[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: 
- list: a list of numbers
- num: a number to compare the elements of the list against

Output: 
- result: a list of numbers from the input list that are greater than the specified number

Process:
1: Initialize an empty list called `result`
2: Loop through each element `element` in the input `list`
3:     If `element` is greater than `num`:
4:         Add `element` to the `result` list
5: After the loop, return the `result` list
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def greater_specificnum(list, num):
    result = []
    for element in list:
        if element > num:
            result.append(element)
    return result
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `greater_specificnum` takes two parameters: `list`, which is a list of numbers, and `num`, which is the number to compare against. The function initializes an empty list called `result` to store the numbers that are greater than `num`. It then iterates over each element in the input list. For each element, it checks if the element is greater than `num`. If it is, the element is added to the `result` list. After the loop completes, the function returns the `result` list containing all the numbers from the input list that are greater than the specified number.
