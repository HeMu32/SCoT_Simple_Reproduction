Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list
Output: sum of repeated elements in the list

1: Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the count of each element in the list
2: Initialize a variable `sum_repeated` to 0 to store the sum of repeated elements
3: Loop through each element in the list:
4:     If the element is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
5:     If the element is already in the dictionary, increment its count
6: Loop through the dictionary:
7:     If the count of an element is greater than 1, add the element multiplied by its count to `sum_repeated`
8: Return `sum_repeated`
