Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two tuples of the same length containing boolean values (True or False)
Output: result_tup: a tuple containing the element-wise AND of the two input tuples

1: Initialize an empty list result_list to store the results of the AND operation
2: for each index i from 0 to the length of test_tup1 - 1:
3:     if test_tup1[i] AND test_tup2[i] is True:
4:         append True to result_list
5:     else:
6:         append False to result_list
7: Convert result_list to a tuple result_tup
8: return result_tup
