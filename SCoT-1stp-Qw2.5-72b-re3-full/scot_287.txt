Input: n: an integer representing the number of first even natural numbers to consider
Output: sum_of_squares: the sum of squares of the first n even natural numbers
1: Initialize sum_of_squares to 0
2: for each number i from 1 to n:
3:     calculate the i-th even number (2 * i)
4:     square the i-th even number
5:     add the squared value to sum_of_squares
6: return sum_of_squares
