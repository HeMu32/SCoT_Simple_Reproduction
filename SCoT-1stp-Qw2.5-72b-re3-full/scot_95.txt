Input: lst: a list of sublists containing any type of elements
Output: min_length: the minimum length of the sublists in the given list

1: Initialize min_length to a very large number (or use the length of the first sublist as a starting point)
2: For each sublist in lst:
3:     Compute the length of the current sublist
4:     If the length of the current sublist is less than min_length:
5:         Update min_length to the length of the current sublist
6: Return min_length
