[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: The first even number in the list, or None if no even number is found

1: For each number num in nums:
2:     If num is even (i.e., num % 2 == 0):
3:         Return num
4: If no even number is found after the loop:
5:     Return None
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def first_even(nums):
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return num
    return None
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `first_even` takes a list of integers as input and returns the first even number it encounters in the list. It iterates through the list using a for loop. For each number, it checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator `%`. If the number is even, it immediately returns that number. If the loop completes without finding an even number, the function returns `None` to indicate that no even number was found in the list. This approach ensures that the function is efficient, stopping as soon as it finds the first even number.
