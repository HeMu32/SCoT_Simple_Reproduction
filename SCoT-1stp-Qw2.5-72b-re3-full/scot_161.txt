Input: list1, list2: two lists of elements
Output: a new list containing elements from list1 that are not present in list2

1: Initialize an empty list called `result` to store the elements that are in list1 but not in list2.
2: Loop through each element in list1.
3: For each element, check if it is not in list2.
4: If the element is not in list2, append it to the `result` list.
5: After the loop ends, return the `result` list.
