Certainly! Let's break down the task and solve it step by step.

### Understanding the Requirement
The function `find_exponentio(test_tup1, test_tup2)` is required to perform exponentiation of the elements from two given tuples. Specifically, for each pair of elements `(a, b)` where `a` is from `test_tup1` and `b` is from `test_tup2`, the function should compute `a ** b` and return a new tuple containing these results.

### Solving Process
[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: 
- `test_tup1`: a tuple of integers
- `test_tup2`: a tuple of integers

Output: 
- `result_tup`: a tuple containing the results of `a ** b` for each pair `(a, b)` from `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`

1: Initialize an empty list `result_list` to store the results
2: Ensure both tuples have the same length
3: for each index `i` from 0 to the length of `test_tup1`:
4:     Compute `test_tup1[i] ** test_tup2[i]`
5:     Append the result to `result_list`
6: Convert `result_list` to a tuple `result_tup`
7: Return `result_tup`
[END PROCESS]

### Code Implementation
[BEGIN CODE]
def find_exponentio(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    # Ensure both tuples have the same length
    if len(test_tup1) != len(test_tup2):
        raise ValueError("Both tuples must have the same length")
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the results
    result_list = []
    
    # Loop through each index of the tuples
    for i in range(len(test_tup1)):
        # Compute the exponentiation
        result = test_tup1[i] ** test_tup2[i]
        # Append the result to the list
        result_list.append(result)
    
    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it
    result_tup = tuple(result_list)
    return result_tup
[END CODE]

### Explanation
1. **Input Validation**: The function first checks if both input tuples have the same length. If they do not, it raises a `ValueError` to indicate that the operation cannot be performed.
2. **Initialization**: An empty list `result_list` is initialized to store the results of the exponentiation.
3. **Looping and Computation**: A `for` loop iterates over the indices of the tuples. For each index `i`, the function computes `test_tup1[i] ** test_tup2[i]` and appends the result to `result_list`.
4. **Conversion and Return**: After the loop, the list `result_list` is converted to a tuple `result_tup` and returned.

This approach ensures that the function performs the required exponentiation operation correctly and handles cases where the input tuples have different lengths.
