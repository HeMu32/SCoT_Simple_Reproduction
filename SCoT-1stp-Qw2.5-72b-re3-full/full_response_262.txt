[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list1: a list, L: an integer representing the length of the first part of the list
Output: A tuple containing two lists, where the first list is the first L elements of list1, and the second list contains the remaining elements

1: Check if the length of list1 is less than L
2:     If true, return the entire list1 as the first part and an empty list as the second part
3: Otherwise, split the list into two parts:
4:     The first part contains the first L elements of list1
5:     The second part contains the elements from the L+1-th position to the end of list1
6: Return a tuple containing the two parts
[END PROCESS]

Explanation:
- The function `split_two_parts` takes two parameters: `list1`, which is the list to be split, and `L`, which is the length of the first part of the list.
- The function first checks if the length of `list1` is less than `L`. If it is, it means the entire list cannot be split into two parts where the first part has `L` elements. In this case, the function returns the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part.
- If the length of `list1` is greater than or equal to `L`, the function splits the list into two parts:
  - The first part contains the first `L` elements of `list1`.
  - The second part contains the elements from the `L+1`-th position to the end of `list1`.
- Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the two parts.
