Input: n: an integer representing the number of first even natural numbers to consider
Output: sum: the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers

1: Initialize a variable sum to 0 to store the cumulative sum of cubes.
2: Loop from 1 to n (inclusive) with a loop variable i:
3:     Calculate the i-th even number as 2 * i.
4:     Calculate the cube of the i-th even number.
5:     Add the cube to the sum.
6: Return the sum.
