Input: l, w, h: three integers or floats representing the length, width, and height of a cuboid.
Output: The volume of the cuboid as a float or integer.

1: Calculate the volume by multiplying the length, width, and height.
2: Return the calculated volume.
[END PROCESS]

    Write a function to find the volume of a cuboid.

### Explanation:
The function `volume_cuboid` takes three parameters: `l` (length), `w` (width), and `h` (height), which represent the dimensions of a cuboid. The volume of a cuboid is calculated by multiplying these three dimensions together. The result is then returned as the output of the function. This is a straightforward calculation that does not require any complex logic or control structures.
