Input: l: a list of colors, n: an integer representing the number of colors to choose
Output: A list of all combinations of `n` colors from the list `l` with repetitions allowed

1: Initialize an empty list `result` to store the combinations.
2: Use a recursive function to generate combinations.
3: The recursive function should take the current combination, the remaining number of colors to choose, and the starting index in the list `l`.
4: If the remaining number of colors to choose is 0, add the current combination to `result`.
5: Otherwise, loop through the list `l` starting from the current index:
6:     Add the current color to the combination.
7:     Recursively call the function with the updated combination, the remaining number of colors decreased by 1, and the current index (to allow repetitions).
8:     Remove the last color from the combination (backtrack).
9: Return the `result` list containing all combinations.
