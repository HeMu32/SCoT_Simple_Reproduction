Input: An array of integers
Output: The largest palindromic number in the array

1: Initialize a variable `max_palindrome` to None, which will store the largest palindrome found.
2: Iterate through each element in the array.
3: For each element:
4:     Convert the element to a string.
5:     Check if the string is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
6:     If it is a palindrome and either `max_palindrome` is None or the current element is greater than `max_palindrome`, update `max_palindrome` with the current element.
7: After the loop, if `max_palindrome` is still None, return a message indicating no palindromic number was found.
8: Otherwise, return `max_palindrome`.
