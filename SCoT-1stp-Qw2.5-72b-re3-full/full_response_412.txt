[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: l: a list of integers
Output: res: a list of integers with all odd numbers removed

1: Initialize an empty list res to store the result
2: For each element ele in the list l:
3:     If ele is even (ele % 2 == 0):
4:         Append ele to res
5: Return res
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def remove_odd(l):
    res = [ele for ele in l if ele % 2 == 0]
    return res
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `remove_odd` is designed to filter out all odd numbers from a given list `l`. The process involves iterating through each element in the list and checking if it is even. If the element is even, it is added to the result list `res`. This is achieved using a list comprehension, which is a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. The condition `ele % 2 == 0` checks if the element is even, and only even elements are included in the resulting list. Finally, the function returns the list `res` containing only the even numbers from the original list.
