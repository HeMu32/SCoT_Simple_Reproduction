Input: n: an integer  
Output: result: the smallest power of 2 that is greater than or equal to n  
1: If n is less than or equal to 0, return 1 (since the smallest power of 2 is 1)  
2: Initialize a variable `result` to 1  
3: While `result` is less than `n`:  
4:     Multiply `result` by 2  
5: Return `result`
