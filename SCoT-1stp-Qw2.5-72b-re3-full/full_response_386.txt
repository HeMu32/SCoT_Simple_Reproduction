[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: s: a string consisting of brackets, e.g., "[]", "][", "[][]", etc.
Output: an integer representing the minimum number of swaps required to balance the brackets in the string.

1: Initialize two counters: `open_brackets` to count the number of open brackets and `swaps` to count the number of swaps needed.
2: Iterate through each character in the string `s`:
3:     If the character is an opening bracket '[':
4:         Increment `open_brackets` by 1.
5:     If the character is a closing bracket ']':
6:         If `open_brackets` is greater than 0, it means there is an unmatched opening bracket that can be matched with this closing bracket:
7:             Decrement `open_brackets` by 1.
8:         Otherwise, it means there is no unmatched opening bracket to match this closing bracket, so a swap is needed:
9:             Increment `swaps` by 1.
10: After the loop, if `open_brackets` is not 0, it means there are unmatched opening brackets left, which will require additional swaps to balance:
11:     Increment `swaps` by `open_brackets` // 2 (since each pair of unmatched opening brackets can be balanced with one swap).
12: Return the total number of swaps.

### Explanation:
The function `swap_count` calculates the minimum number of swaps required to balance a string of brackets. The algorithm works by iterating through the string and maintaining a count of unmatched opening brackets. When a closing bracket is encountered and there are no unmatched opening brackets to pair with it, a swap is counted. After the loop, any remaining unmatched opening brackets are paired with each other, and the number of swaps needed for this is added to the total. This approach ensures that the minimum number of swaps is calculated efficiently.
