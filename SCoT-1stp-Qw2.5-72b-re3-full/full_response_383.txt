Input: A number (integer)
Output: A number with all odd bits toggled

1: Define the function even_bit_toggle_number with a parameter num
2: Initialize a variable mask to 0
3: Initialize a variable bit_position to 0
4: Loop while (1 << bit_position) is less than or equal to num:
5:     If bit_position is odd:
6:         Set the bit at bit_position in mask
7:     Increment bit_position by 1
8: XOR num with mask to toggle all odd bits
9: Return the result of the XOR operation

### Explanation

The function `even_bit_toggle_number` is designed to toggle all odd bits of a given number. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how it works:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `mask` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to create a bitmask where all the odd bits are set to 1.
   - `bit_position` is initialized to 0. This variable will be used to iterate through each bit position of the number.

2. **Loop through bit positions**:
   - The loop continues as long as `(1 << bit_position)` is less than or equal to `num`. This ensures that we only consider bit positions that are within the range of the number.
   - Inside the loop, we check if the current `bit_position` is odd. If it is, we set the corresponding bit in `mask` using the bitwise OR operator (`|`).

3. **Toggle odd bits**:
   - After the loop, `mask` contains 1s in all the odd bit positions.
   - We use the XOR operator (`^`) to toggle the bits in `num` where the corresponding bits in `mask` are 1.

4. **Return the result**:
   - The function returns the result of the XOR operation, which is the number with all odd bits toggled.

This approach ensures that we correctly toggle the odd bits of the given number. The use of bitwise operations makes the solution efficient and straightforward.
