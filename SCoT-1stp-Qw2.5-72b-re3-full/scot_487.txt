Input: tup: a list of tuples
Output: sorted_tup: a list of tuples sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple

1: Define a helper function `last` that takes a tuple and returns its last element.
2: Use the `sorted` function with a key argument set to the helper function `last` to sort the list of tuples based on their last elements.
3: Return the sorted list of tuples.
