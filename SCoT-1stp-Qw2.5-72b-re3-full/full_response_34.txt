[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: ar: a sorted list of integers, N: the length of the list including the missing number
Output: The missing number in the list

1: Initialize a variable 'low' to 0 and 'high' to N - 1
2: While 'low' is less than or equal to 'high':
3:     Calculate 'mid' as the floor of (low + high) / 2
4:     If the element at index 'mid' is equal to 'mid' + 1:
5:         The missing number is not in the left half, so set 'low' to 'mid' + 1
6:     Else:
7:         The missing number is in the left half, so set 'high' to 'mid' - 1
8: The missing number is 'low' + 1
9: Return the missing number

Explanation:
The function `find_missing` is designed to find the missing number in a sorted array of integers. The array is expected to contain numbers from 1 to N, but one number is missing. The function uses a binary search approach to efficiently find the missing number.

- The function initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to the start and end of the array, respectively.
- It then enters a loop that continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the middle index `mid`.
- If the element at `mid` is equal to `mid + 1`, it means the missing number is not in the left half of the array, so it updates `low` to `mid + 1`.
- If the element at `mid` is not equal to `mid + 1`, it means the missing number is in the left half, so it updates `high` to `mid - 1`.
- Once the loop exits, the missing number is `low + 1`, which is returned by the function.

This approach ensures that the function runs in O(log N) time, making it efficient for large arrays.
