[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: a: a list of integers, x: an integer to find the frequency of
Output: frequency: the number of times x appears in the list a

1: Initialize a variable `frequency` to 0 to keep track of the occurrences of `x`
2: Loop through each element `element` in the list `a`
3:     If `element` is equal to `x`:
4:         Increment `frequency` by 1
5: After the loop, return the value of `frequency`
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def frequency(a, x):
    frequency = 0
    for element in a:
        if element == x:
            frequency += 1
    return frequency
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `frequency` takes two parameters: a list `a` and an integer `x`. The goal is to count how many times `x` appears in the list `a`. The process involves initializing a counter `frequency` to 0, then iterating through each element in the list. For each element, if it matches `x`, the counter is incremented by 1. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `frequency`, which represents the number of occurrences of `x` in the list `a`. This approach is straightforward and efficient for finding the frequency of a specific element in a list.
