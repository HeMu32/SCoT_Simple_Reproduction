Input: N: an odd integer
Output: avg: the average of all odd numbers up to and including N

1: Initialize a variable `sum_of_odds` to 0 to store the sum of odd numbers.
2: Initialize a variable `count_of_odds` to 0 to count the number of odd numbers.
3: For each number `i` from 1 to N (inclusive):
4:     If `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2` is not equal to 0):
5:         Add `i` to `sum_of_odds`.
6:         Increment `count_of_odds` by 1.
7: Calculate the average `avg` as `sum_of_odds` divided by `count_of_odds`.
8: Return `avg`.
