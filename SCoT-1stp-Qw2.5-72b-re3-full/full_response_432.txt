Input: base1: length of the first base of the trapezium, base2: length of the second base of the trapezium, height: height of the trapezium
Output: median: the length of the median (or midsegment) of the trapezium

1: Calculate the median of the trapezium using the formula:
2:     median = (base1 + base2) / 2
3: Return the calculated median
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def median_trapezium(base1, base2, height):
    median = (base1 + base2) / 2
    return median
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The median (or midsegment) of a trapezium is a line segment that connects the midpoints of the non-parallel sides. The length of the median can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{median} = \frac{\text{base1} + \text{base2}}{2} \]

This formula is derived from the fact that the median of a trapezium is the average of the lengths of the two bases. The height of the trapezium is not needed to calculate the median, but it is included in the function parameters to match the given function signature. The function simply computes the median using the provided base lengths and returns the result.
