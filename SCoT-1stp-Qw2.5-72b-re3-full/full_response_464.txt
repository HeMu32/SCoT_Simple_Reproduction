[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: dict: a dictionary with values, n: a value to check against
Output: result: a boolean indicating if all values in the dictionary are equal to n

1: Initialize a variable result to True
2: For each value in the dictionary do
3:     If the value is not equal to n then
4:         Set result to False
5:         Break the loop
6: Return result
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def check_value(dict, n):
    result = True
    for value in dict.values():
        if value != n:
            result = False
            break
    return result
[END CODE]

Explanation:
The function `check_value` takes a dictionary `dict` and a value `n` as inputs. It checks if all the values in the dictionary are equal to `n`. The function iterates over each value in the dictionary using a for loop. If any value is found that is not equal to `n`, the function sets the result to `False` and breaks out of the loop. If the loop completes without finding any value that is not equal to `n`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach ensures that the function efficiently stops checking as soon as it finds a value that does not match `n`.
