Input: text: a string  
Output: matches: a list of substrings that match the pattern of one uppercase letter followed by lowercase letters  
1: Import the re module for regular expression operations  
2: Define the regex pattern to match one uppercase letter followed by zero or more lowercase letters  
3: Use the re.findall() function to find all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the text  
4: Store the matches in a list called matches  
5: Return the matches list
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
import re

def match(text):
    # Define the regex pattern
    pattern = r'[A-Z][a-z]*'
    
    # Find all matches in the text
    matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
    
    # Return the list of matches
    return matches

### Explanation:
- **Regex Pattern**: `[A-Z][a-z]*`
  - `[A-Z]`: Matches any single uppercase letter.
  - `[a-z]*`: Matches zero or more lowercase letters.
- **re.findall()**: This function returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, as a list of strings. The string is scanned left-to-right, and matches are returned in the order found.
- **Return Value**: The function returns a list of substrings from the input text that match the defined pattern. Each substring starts with an uppercase letter followed by zero or more lowercase letters.
