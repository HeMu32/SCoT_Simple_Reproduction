Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: two tuples of integers
Output: result_tup: a tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from test_tup1 and test_tup2

1: Initialize an empty list to store the results of the multiplication.
2: Check if the lengths of the two input tuples are equal.
3: If the lengths are not equal:
4:     Return None (or an error message) as the operation cannot be performed.
5: If the lengths are equal:
6:     Loop through the indices of the tuples.
7:     For each index, multiply the corresponding elements from test_tup1 and test_tup2.
8:     Append the result to the result list.
9: Convert the result list to a tuple.
10: Return the result tuple.
