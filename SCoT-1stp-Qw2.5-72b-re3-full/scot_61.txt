Input: s: a string, n: the length of the string
Output: count: the number of substrings where the sum of the digits equals the length of the substring

1: Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of valid substrings.
2: For each starting index `i` from 0 to `n-1`:
3:     Initialize a variable `sum_of_digits` to 0 to keep track of the sum of digits in the current substring.
4:     For each ending index `j` from `i` to `n-1`:
5:         If the character at index `j` is a digit:
6:             Add the integer value of the character at index `j` to `sum_of_digits`.
7:         If `sum_of_digits` equals `j - i + 1` (the length of the current substring):
8:             Increment `count` by 1.
9: Return `count`.
