Input: A, B: two integers
Output: operations: the minimum number of operations required to make A and B equal

1: Initialize the variable `operations` to 0 to count the number of operations.
2: While A and B are not equal:
3:     If A is greater than B:
4:         Increment B by 1 (B = B + 1)
5:     Else if B is greater than A:
6:         Increment A by 1 (A = A + 1)
7:     Increment the `operations` counter by 1.
8: Return the `operations` counter.
