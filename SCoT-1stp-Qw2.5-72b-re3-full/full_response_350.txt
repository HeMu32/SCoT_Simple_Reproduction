Input: s: a string
Output: min_length: the minimum length of the string after removing all occurrences of any one character

1: Initialize min_length to the length of the string s
2: for each unique character c in s:
3:     Create a new string s_new by removing all occurrences of c from s
4:     if the length of s_new is less than min_length:
5:         Update min_length to the length of s_new
6: return min_length

### Explanation:
The function `minimum_Length` is designed to find the minimum possible length of a string after removing all occurrences of any single character. The process involves:
- Initializing `min_length` to the length of the input string `s`.
- Iterating over each unique character in the string.
- For each unique character, creating a new string `s_new` by removing all occurrences of that character.
- Checking if the length of `s_new` is less than the current `min_length`.
- If it is, updating `min_length` to the length of `s_new`.
- Finally, returning the `min_length`.

This approach ensures that the function considers the impact of removing each character and finds the minimum length possible.
