Input: test_tup1, test_tup2: Two tuples of integers
Output: A tuple where each element is the maximum of the corresponding elements from the input tuples

1: Initialize an empty list to store the result.
2: Check if the lengths of test_tup1 and test_tup2 are equal.
3: If the lengths are not equal, return an error message or raise an exception.
4: Loop through the indices of the tuples.
5:   For each index, compare the elements from test_tup1 and test_tup2.
6:   Append the larger of the two elements to the result list.
7: Convert the result list to a tuple.
8: Return the resulting tuple.
