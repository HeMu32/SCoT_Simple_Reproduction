Certainly! Let's break down the task and solve it step by step.

### Understanding the Requirement
The function `check_last(arr, n, p)` needs to determine whether the last element of the given array `arr` is even or odd after performing an operation `p` times. The operation is not explicitly defined, so we need to infer it from the context. Typically, such problems involve some form of transformation or update to the array elements.

### Solving Process
1. **Input:**
   - `arr`: a list of integers
   - `n`: the length of the list `arr`
   - `p`: the number of times the operation is to be performed

2. **Output:**
   - A boolean value indicating whether the last element of the array is even or odd after `p` operations.

3. **Operation:**
   - Since the operation is not explicitly defined, we will assume the simplest operation: incrementing each element of the array by 1. This is a common operation in such problems.

4. **Steps:**
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the last element of the array.
   - Perform the operation `p` times:
     - Increment each element of the array by 1.
   - After `p` operations, check if the last element of the array is even or odd.
   - Return `True` if the last element is even, otherwise return `False`.

### Detailed Solving Process
1. **Initialize the last element:**
   - `last_element = arr[-1]`
2. **Perform the operation `p` times:**
   - For each operation, increment each element of the array by 1.
3. **Check if the last element is even or odd:**
   - Use the modulo operator `%` to check if the last element is even (`last_element % 2 == 0`).

### Implementation
Let's implement the function based on the solving process.

[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: arr: a list of integers, n: the length of the list arr, p: the number of times the operation is to be performed
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the last element of the array is even or odd after p operations

1: Initialize last_element to the last element of arr
2: For i from 0 to p-1:
3:     For each element in arr:
4:         Increment the element by 1
5: After the loop, set last_element to the last element of arr
6: Check if last_element is even:
7:     If last_element % 2 == 0:
8:         Return True
9:     Else:
10:         Return False
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def check_last(arr, n, p):
    # Initialize the last element
    last_element = arr[-1]
    
    # Perform the operation p times
    for _ in range(p):
        for i in range(n):
            arr[i] += 1
    
    # Update the last element after p operations
    last_element = arr[-1]
    
    # Check if the last element is even
    return last_element % 2 == 0
[END CODE]

### Explanation
- **Initialization:** We start by initializing `last_element` to the last element of the array `arr`.
- **Operation Loop:** We use a nested loop to perform the operation `p` times. In each iteration, we increment each element of the array by 1.
- **Final Check:** After performing the operations, we update `last_element` to the last element of the array and check if it is even using the modulo operator.
- **Return:** The function returns `True` if the last element is even and `False` otherwise.

This implementation ensures that the function correctly checks the parity of the last element after the specified number of operations.
