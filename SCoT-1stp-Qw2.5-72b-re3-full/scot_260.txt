Input: n: an integer representing the position of the NSW prime to find
Output: the nth NSW prime number

1: Initialize the first two terms of the NSW sequence: \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \)
2: Initialize a list to store the NSW primes found
3: Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of NSW primes found
4: Use a loop to generate terms of the NSW sequence until the nth NSW prime is found
5:   For each term \( S_n \) in the sequence:
6:     Check if \( S_n \) is a prime number
7:     If \( S_n \) is prime:
8:       Add \( S_n \) to the list of NSW primes
9:       Increment the counter
10:      If the counter equals n:
11:        Return the nth NSW prime
12:   Generate the next term \( S_{n+1} \) using the recurrence relation
