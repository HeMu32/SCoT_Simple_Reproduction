Input: text: a string, patterns: a list of strings
Output: matches: a list of tuples, each containing the pattern and the start and end positions of the match in the text

1: Import the `re` module for regular expression operations.
2: Initialize an empty list to store the matches.
3: Loop through each pattern in the patterns list:
   3.1: Use the `re.finditer` function to find all occurrences of the pattern in the text.
   3.2: For each match found, extract the start and end positions of the match.
   3.3: Append a tuple containing the pattern and the start and end positions to the matches list.
4: Return the matches list.
