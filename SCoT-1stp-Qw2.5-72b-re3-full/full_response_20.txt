Certainly! Let's tackle the task of determining whether a given number is a Woodall number or not. A Woodall number is defined as a number of the form \( W(n) = n \cdot 2^n - 1 \) for some integer \( n \).

### Understanding the Requirement
- **Input**: \( x \) (an integer)
- **Output**: A boolean value indicating whether \( x \) is a Woodall number.

### Solving Process
1. **Check if \( x + 1 \) is a power of 2**:
   - If \( x + 1 \) is a power of 2, then \( x + 1 = 2^k \) for some integer \( k \).
   - This can be checked using the property that a number is a power of 2 if and only if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation (i.e., \( (x + 1) \& (x) == 0 \) and \( x + 1 > 0 \)).
2. **Find \( n \) such that \( x = n \cdot 2^n - 1 \)**:
   - If \( x + 1 \) is a power of 2, then \( k = \log_2(x + 1) \).
   - Check if \( n = \frac{x + 1}{2^k} - 1 \) is an integer.
3. **Return the result**:
   - If \( n \) is an integer, then \( x \) is a Woodall number.
   - Otherwise, \( x \) is not a Woodall number.

### Detailed Solving Process
1. **Input**: \( x \)
2. **Check if \( x + 1 \) is a power of 2**:
   - If \( (x + 1) \& (x) == 0 \) and \( x + 1 > 0 \):
     - Calculate \( k \) as \( \log_2(x + 1) \).
     - Calculate \( n \) as \( \frac{x + 1}{2^k} - 1 \).
     - Check if \( n \) is an integer.
3. **Return the result**:
   - If \( n \) is an integer, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

     - Calculate \( k \) as \( \log_2(x + 1) \).
     - Calculate \( n \) as \( \frac{x + 1}{2^k} - 1 \).
     - Check if \( n \) is an integer.
3. Return the result:

def is_woodall(x):
    # Check if x + 1 is a power of 2
    if (x + 1) & x == 0 and x + 1 > 0:
        # Calculate k as log2(x + 1)
        k = (x + 1).bit_length() - 1
        # Calculate n as (x + 1) / 2^k - 1
        n = (x + 1) // (1 << k) - 1
        # Check if n is an integer
        if (x + 1) == (1 << k) * (n + 1):
            return True
    return False

### Explanation
- **Step 1**: We first check if \( x + 1 \) is a power of 2 using the bitwise AND operation. If \( (x + 1) \& x == 0 \) and \( x + 1 > 0 \), then \( x + 1 \) is a power of 2.
- **Step 2**: If \( x + 1 \) is a power of 2, we calculate \( k \) as the position of the highest set bit in \( x + 1 \) using the `bit_length` method.
- **Step 3**: We then calculate \( n \) as \( \frac{x + 1}{2^k} - 1 \). We check if \( n \) is an integer by verifying if \( (x + 1) == (1 << k) * (n + 1) \).
- **Step 4**: If \( n \) is an integer, we return `True`, indicating that \( x \) is a Woodall number. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify Woodall numbers by leveraging the properties of powers of 2 and integer arithmetic.
