Input: item_list: a sorted list of elements, item: the element to search for
Output: The index of the item if found, otherwise -1

1: Initialize two pointers, low and high, to the start and end of the item_list respectively.
2: While low is less than or equal to high:
3:     Calculate mid as the average of low and high.
4:     If the element at mid is equal to item:
5:         Return mid.
6:     If the element at mid is less than item:
7:         Set low to mid + 1.
8:     If the element at mid is greater than item:
9:         Set high to mid - 1.
10: If the loop completes without finding the item:
11:     Return -1.
