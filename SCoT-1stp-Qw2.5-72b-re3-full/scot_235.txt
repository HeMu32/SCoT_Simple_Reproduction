Input: n: an integer
Output: result: an integer with all even bits set to 1

1: Initialize a variable `mask` to 0, which will be used to create a mask with all even bits set to 1.
2: Initialize a variable `bit_position` to 1, which will be used to determine the current bit position.
3: Loop through each bit position from 1 to the number of bits in `n`:
   a: Check if the current bit position is even:
      - If the bit position is even, set the corresponding bit in `mask` to 1.
   b: Increment the `bit_position` by 1.
4: Use the `mask` to set all even bits in `n` by performing a bitwise OR operation between `n` and `mask`.
5: Return the result of the bitwise OR operation.
