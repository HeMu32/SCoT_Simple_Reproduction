Input: list1: a list of numbers, m: an integer representing the start index, n: an integer representing the end index
Output: sum: the sum of the numbers in list1 between the indices m and n (inclusive)

1: Check if m and n are valid indices for list1.
2: Initialize sum to 0.
3: For each index i from m to n (inclusive):
4:     Add the element at index i in list1 to sum.
5: Return sum.
