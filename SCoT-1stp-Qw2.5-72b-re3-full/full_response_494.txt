[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_tup: a tuple containing binary digits (0s and 1s)
Output: an integer that represents the binary number in the tuple

1: Convert the tuple into a string, where each element of the tuple is concatenated together.
2: Use the int() function with base 2 to convert the binary string into an integer.
3: Return the integer.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def binary_to_integer(test_tup):
    # Convert the tuple to a string
    binary_str = ''.join(str(x) for x in test_tup)
    # Convert the binary string to an integer
    result = int(binary_str, 2)
    # Return the integer
    return result
[END CODE]

**Explanation:**
- The function `binary_to_integer` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input, which contains binary digits (0s and 1s).
- The first step is to convert the tuple into a string where each element is concatenated together. This is done using a generator expression inside the `join` method.
- The second step is to convert the resulting binary string into an integer using the `int` function with base 2.
- Finally, the function returns the integer value, which represents the binary number in the tuple.
