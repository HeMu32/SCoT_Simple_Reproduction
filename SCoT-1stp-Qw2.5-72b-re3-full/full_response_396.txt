[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: string: a string to be checked
Output: True or False: indicating whether the string starts and ends with the same character

1: Import the `re` module for regular expression operations
2: Define a regular expression pattern that matches strings starting and ending with the same character
3: Use the `re.match` function to check if the string matches the pattern
4: If the match is found:
5:     return True
6: Else:
7:     return False
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
import re

def check_char(string):
    # Define the regex pattern to match strings that start and end with the same character
    pattern = r'^(.).*\1$'
    
    # Use re.match to check if the string matches the pattern
    match = re.match(pattern, string)
    
    # Return True if a match is found, otherwise return False
    return bool(match)
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
- **Regex Pattern Explanation:**
  - `^(.)`: This part of the pattern matches the first character of the string and captures it in a group.
  - `.*`: This matches any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence) between the first and last characters.
  - `\1$`: This part of the pattern matches the same character that was captured in the first group (i.e., the first character) at the end of the string.
- **Function Logic:**
  - The function uses the `re.match` function to check if the string matches the defined pattern.
  - If a match is found, it means the string starts and ends with the same character, so the function returns `True`.
  - If no match is found, the function returns `False`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies strings that start and end with the same character using regular expressions.
