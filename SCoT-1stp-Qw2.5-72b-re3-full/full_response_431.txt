[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list1, list2: two lists of elements
Output: A boolean value indicating whether the two lists have at least one common element

1: Convert list1 to a set for efficient look-up operations.
2: Iterate through each element in list2.
3: For each element in list2, check if it exists in the set created from list1.
4: If a common element is found, return True.
5: If the loop completes without finding any common elements, return False.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def common_element(list1, list2):
    # Convert list1 to a set for efficient look-up
    set1 = set(list1)
    
    # Iterate through each element in list2
    for element in list2:
        # Check if the element exists in set1
        if element in set1:
            # If a common element is found, return True
            return True
    
    # If no common elements are found, return False
    return False
[END CODE]

**Explanation:**
- The function `common_element` is designed to determine if there is at least one common element between two lists, `list1` and `list2`.
- By converting `list1` to a set (`set1`), we can perform membership tests in constant time, which is more efficient than checking each element in a list.
- The function iterates through each element in `list2` and checks if it exists in `set1`. If a common element is found, the function immediately returns `True`.
- If the loop completes without finding any common elements, the function returns `False`.
- This approach ensures that the function is both efficient and straightforward to understand.
