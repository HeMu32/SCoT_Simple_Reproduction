Input: n: an integer representing the total number of items, k: an integer representing the number of items to arrange
Output: The permutation coefficient P(n, k)

1: Initialize a variable result to 1, which will store the final permutation coefficient.
2: Check if k is greater than n:
3:     If true, return 0 as it's not possible to arrange more items than available.
4: Initialize a loop to iterate from 0 to k-1:
5:     In each iteration, multiply result by (n - i) to calculate the permutation coefficient incrementally.
6: Return the result.
