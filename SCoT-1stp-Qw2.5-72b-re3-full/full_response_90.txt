[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: list1: a list of strings
Output: length of the longest string in list1

1: Initialize a variable max_length to 0 to keep track of the longest word length
2: Loop through each word in list1:
3:     If the length of the current word is greater than max_length:
4:         Update max_length to the length of the current word
5: Return max_length as the length of the longest word
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def len_log(list1):
    max_length = 0
    for word in list1:
        if len(word) > max_length:
            max_length = len(word)
    return max_length
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `len_log` is designed to find the length of the longest word in a given list of strings (`list1`). The process involves initializing a variable `max_length` to 0, which will store the length of the longest word found so far. The function then iterates through each word in the list, comparing the length of the current word to `max_length`. If the current word's length is greater than `max_length`, `max_length` is updated to the length of the current word. After the loop completes, `max_length` will contain the length of the longest word in the list, which is then returned. This approach ensures that the function efficiently finds the longest word length with a single pass through the list.
