[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: str1: a string  
Output: count: the total number of characters in str1  

1: Initialize a variable `count` to 0 to keep track of the number of characters  
2: Loop through each character `char` in the string `str1`:  
3:     Increment `count` by 1  
4: Return `count` as the total number of characters in the string
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def count_charac(str1):
    count = 0
    for char in str1:
        count += 1
    return count
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
The function `count_charac` is designed to count the total number of characters in a given string `str1`. The process involves initializing a counter variable `count` to 0. Then, the function iterates over each character in the string, incrementing the counter by 1 for each character. Finally, the function returns the total count of characters. This approach ensures that all characters, including spaces and special characters, are counted.
