Input: n: a number to be rounded, m: the multiple to which n should be rounded
Output: the nearest multiple of m to n

1: Calculate the remainder of n divided by m
2: If the remainder is less than half of m:
3:     Round down to the nearest multiple of m
4: Else:
5:     Round up to the nearest multiple of m
6: Return the rounded value
