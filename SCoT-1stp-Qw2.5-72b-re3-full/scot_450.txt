Input: 
- str: a list of strings
- l: an integer representing the length of the strings to extract

Output: 
- res: a list of strings from the input list that have a length equal to `l`

1: Initialize an empty list `res` to store the result.
2: Loop through each string `s` in the input list `str`.
3:     If the length of `s` is equal to `l`:
4:         Append `s` to the list `res`.
5: After the loop, return the list `res`.
