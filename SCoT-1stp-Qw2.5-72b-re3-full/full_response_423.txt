The Gold Mine problem is a classic dynamic programming problem where the goal is to collect the maximum amount of gold starting from any cell in the first column and moving to any cell in the last column. You can move to the right, right-up, or right-down from any cell.

### Problem Understanding:
- **Input:**
  - `gold`: A 2D list representing the gold mine where each cell contains a certain amount of gold.
  - `m`: Number of rows in the gold mine.
  - `n`: Number of columns in the gold mine.
- **Output:**
  - The maximum amount of gold that can be collected.

### Solving Process:
[BEGIN PROCESS]
1. **Initialize a 2D list `dp`** of size `m x n` to store the maximum gold that can be collected up to each cell.
2. **Copy the first column of `gold` to `dp`** since the maximum gold collected from the first column is the gold in that cell itself.
3. **Iterate through each cell in the gold mine starting from the second column**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the current column:
     - **Check the possible moves** from the previous column:
       - Move from the cell directly to the left.
       - Move from the cell diagonally up to the left.
       - Move from the cell diagonally down to the left.
     - **Update `dp[i][j]`** with the maximum gold collected from the possible moves plus the gold in the current cell.
4. **Find the maximum value in the last column of `dp`** which represents the maximum gold that can be collected.
5. **Return the maximum value**.
[END PROCESS]

### Code Implementation:
[BEGIN CODE]
def get_maxgold(gold, m, n):
    # Initialize a 2D list dp with the same dimensions as gold
    dp = [[0 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Copy the first column of gold to dp
    for i in range(m):
        dp[i][0] = gold[i][0]
    
    # Iterate through each cell in the gold mine starting from the second column
    for j in range(1, n):
        for i in range(m):
            # Initialize the maximum gold collected from the previous column to 0
            max_gold = 0
            
            # Check the possible moves from the previous column
            if i > 0:
                max_gold = max(max_gold, dp[i-1][j-1])  # Move from the cell diagonally up to the left
            if i < m - 1:
                max_gold = max(max_gold, dp[i+1][j-1])  # Move from the cell diagonally down to the left
            max_gold = max(max_gold, dp[i][j-1])  # Move from the cell directly to the left
            
            # Update dp[i][j] with the maximum gold collected from the possible moves plus the gold in the current cell
            dp[i][j] = gold[i][j] + max_gold
    
    # Find the maximum value in the last column of dp
    max_gold_collected = max(dp[i][n-1] for i in range(m))
    
    # Return the maximum value
    return max_gold_collected
[END CODE]

### Explanation:
- **Initialization:** We initialize a 2D list `dp` to store the maximum gold collected up to each cell. The first column of `dp` is initialized with the values from the first column of `gold` because the maximum gold collected from the first column is the gold in that cell itself.
- **Dynamic Programming Table Update:** We iterate through each cell in the gold mine starting from the second column. For each cell `(i, j)`, we consider the possible moves from the previous column and update `dp[i][j]` with the maximum gold collected from these moves plus the gold in the current cell.
- **Result Extraction:** The maximum value in the last column of `dp` represents the maximum gold that can be collected, which is the final result.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum gold that can be collected using dynamic programming, with a time complexity of O(m * n).
