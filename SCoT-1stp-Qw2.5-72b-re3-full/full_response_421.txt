[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_tup: a tuple containing elements that can be converted to strings
Output: result: a single string where each element of the tuple is concatenated with a delimiter (a space by default)

1: Initialize an empty string `result`
2: Loop through each element in `test_tup`
3:     Convert the current element to a string
4:     If the `result` is still empty (i.e., this is the first element):
5:         Append the string representation of the current element to `result`
6:     Else:
7:         Append a delimiter (space) followed by the string representation of the current element to `result`
8: Return `result`
[END PROCESS]

        element_str = str(element)
        if result == '':

### Explanation:
The function `concatenate_tuple` takes a tuple `test_tup` and an optional delimiter (defaulting to a space) as input. It concatenates all elements of the tuple into a single string, with each element separated by the specified delimiter. The function works as follows:

1. **Initialization**: An empty string `result` is initialized to store the final concatenated string.
2. **Loop Through Tuple**: A loop iterates over each element in the tuple `test_tup`.
3. **Convert to String**: Each element is converted to a string using `str(element)`.
4. **Concatenation**:
   - If `result` is still empty (i.e., this is the first element), the string representation of the element is directly appended to `result`.
   - For subsequent elements, a delimiter is appended to `result` followed by the string representation of the element.
5. **Return Result**: After the loop completes, the concatenated string `result` is returned.

This approach ensures that the elements are concatenated correctly with the specified delimiter, and the first element is not preceded by a delimiter.
