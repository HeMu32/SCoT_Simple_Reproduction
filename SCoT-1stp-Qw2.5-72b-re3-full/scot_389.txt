Input: n: an integer representing the position in the Lucas sequence
Output: the n'th Lucas number

1: Define the base cases for the Lucas sequence:
   - The 0th Lucas number is 2.
   - The 1st Lucas number is 1.
2: For n > 1, calculate the n'th Lucas number using the formula:
   - Lucas(n) = Lucas(n-1) + Lucas(n-2)
3: Use a loop to compute the Lucas number iteratively to avoid the exponential time complexity of a naive recursive approach.
4: Return the n'th Lucas number.
