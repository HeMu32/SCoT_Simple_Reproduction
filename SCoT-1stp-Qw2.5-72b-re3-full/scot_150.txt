Input: a: an integer (starting number of the sequence)
       b: an integer (step or increment between consecutive numbers)
       c: an integer (number to check if it is in the sequence)
Output: A boolean value indicating whether `c` is in the sequence

1: Calculate the difference `diff` between `c` and `a`
2: Check if `b` is zero:
   2.1: If `b` is zero, return `True` if `a` equals `c`, otherwise return `False`
3: Check if `diff` is divisible by `b`:
   3.1: If `diff` is divisible by `b`, calculate `k` as `diff // b`
   3.2: Check if `k` is non-negative:
         3.2.1: If `k` is non-negative, return `True`
         3.2.2: If `k` is negative, return `False`
4: If `diff` is not divisible by `b`, return `False`
