### Explanation:
The function `even_binomial_Coeff_Sum` calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices for a given `n`. The binomial coefficient, often denoted as \( C(n, k) \) or \( \binom{n}{k} \), represents the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements without regard to the order of selection. The function uses the `comb` function from the `math` module to compute the binomial coefficients.

1. **Initialization**: The variable `sum` is initialized to 0 to accumulate the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices.
2. **Loop**: A loop iterates over all indices from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
3. **Condition**: Inside the loop, an `if` statement checks if the current index `i` is even.
4. **Calculation**: If the index is even, the binomial coefficient \( C(n, i) \) is calculated using `comb(n, i)`.
5. **Accumulation**: The calculated binomial coefficient is added to `sum`.
6. **Return**: After the loop completes, the function returns the accumulated sum.

This approach ensures that only the binomial coefficients at even indices are summed, as required by the problem statement.
