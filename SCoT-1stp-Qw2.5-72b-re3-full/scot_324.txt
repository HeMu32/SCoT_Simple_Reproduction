Input: test_tuple: a tuple of integers
Output: sum_of_alternates: the sum of elements at alternate positions in the tuple

1: Initialize a variable `sum_of_alternates` to 0 to store the sum of alternate elements.
2: Loop through the elements of `test_tuple` with an index, starting from index 0.
3:     If the index is even (i.e., the element is at an alternate position starting from the first element):
4:         Add the current element to `sum_of_alternates`.
5: After the loop, return the value of `sum_of_alternates`.
