### Explanation:
The function `volume_cylinder` takes two parameters: `r` (the radius of the cylinder) and `h` (the height of the cylinder). The goal is to calculate the volume of the cylinder using the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( \pi \) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159. The function then returns the calculated volume.

1. **Define the value of π (pi):** The value of π is defined as a constant within the function to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. **Calculate the volume:** The volume is calculated using the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where `r` is the radius and `h` is the height.
3. **Return the volume:** The calculated volume is returned as the output of the function.
