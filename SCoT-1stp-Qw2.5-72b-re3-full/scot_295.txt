Input: number: an integer for which we need to find the sum of all divisors.
Output: sum_divisors: the sum of all divisors of the given number.

1: Initialize a variable sum_divisors to 0 to store the sum of divisors.
2: For each integer i from 1 to the square root of number (inclusive):
3:     If number is divisible by i (i.e., number % i == 0):
4:         Add i to sum_divisors.
5:         If i is not equal to number // i (to avoid adding the square root twice if it's a perfect square):
6:             Add number // i to sum_divisors.
7: Return sum_divisors.
