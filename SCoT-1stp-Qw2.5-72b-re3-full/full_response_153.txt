### Explanation:
The vertex of a parabola given by the quadratic equation \( y = ax^2 + bx + c \) can be found using the vertex formula. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by:

\[ x = -\frac{b}{2a} \]

Once the x-coordinate is known, the y-coordinate can be found by substituting \( x \) back into the quadratic equation:

\[ y = ax^2 + bx + c \]

The function `parabola_vertex` takes three parameters \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), which are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. It calculates the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula, then calculates the y-coordinate by substituting the x-coordinate into the quadratic equation. Finally, it returns the vertex as a tuple \((x, y)\).
