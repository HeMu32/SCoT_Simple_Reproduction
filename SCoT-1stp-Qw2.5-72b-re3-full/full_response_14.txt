Input: base, height, length: three positive numbers representing the base, height of the triangle, and the length of the prism, respectively.
Output: volume: the volume of the triangular prism.

1: Calculate the area of the triangular base using the formula (base * height) / 2.
2: Multiply the area of the base by the length of the prism to get the volume.
3: Return the volume.

### Explanation:
The function `find_Volume` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The volume of a triangular prism is given by the product of the area of its triangular base and its length. The area of the triangular base is calculated using the formula \(\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\). Once the area is known, the volume is calculated by multiplying the area by the length of the prism. The function takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, and returns the volume as a result.
