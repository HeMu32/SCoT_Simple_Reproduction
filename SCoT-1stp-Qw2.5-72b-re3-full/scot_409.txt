Input: list1: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers
Output: min_product: the minimum product of the pairs of integers from the tuples in the list

1: Initialize min_product to None
2: Loop through each tuple in list1:
3:     Calculate the product of the two integers in the current tuple
4:     If min_product is None or the current product is less than min_product:
5:         Set min_product to the current product
6: Return min_product
