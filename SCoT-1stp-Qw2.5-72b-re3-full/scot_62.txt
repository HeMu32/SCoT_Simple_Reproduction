Input: xs: a list of numbers
Output: smallest: the smallest number in the list
1: Check if the list is empty, if it is, return None or raise an error (since there is no smallest number in an empty list)
2: Initialize smallest with the first element of the list
3: Loop through the list starting from the second element
4: For each element, if it is smaller than the current smallest, update smallest
5: After the loop, return the smallest number
