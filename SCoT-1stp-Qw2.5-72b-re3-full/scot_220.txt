Input: text: a string, n: an integer representing the maximum number of occurrences to replace
Output: modified_text: a string with up to n occurrences of spaces, commas, or dots replaced by colons

1: Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of replacements made
2: Convert the text into a list of characters to allow modification
3: Loop through each character in the text
4:   if the character is a space, comma, or dot and the counter is less than n:
5:     replace the character with a colon
6:     increment the counter
7:   if the counter reaches n, break the loop
8: Join the list of characters back into a string
9: Return the modified string
