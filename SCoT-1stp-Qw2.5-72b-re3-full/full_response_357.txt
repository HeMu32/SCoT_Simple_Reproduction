[BEGIN PROCESS]
Input: test_list: a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numeric elements
Output: res: the maximum numeric value found in any of the tuples

1: Initialize a variable `max_value` to store the maximum value found, setting it initially to the lowest possible integer value.
2: Loop through each tuple in the test_list.
3:     For each element in the current tuple:
4:         If the element is greater than the current `max_value`, update `max_value` to this element.
5: After the loop, `max_value` will contain the maximum value found in all tuples.
6: Return `max_value`.
[END PROCESS]

[BEGIN CODE]
def find_max(test_list):
  max_value = float('-inf')  # Initialize max_value to negative infinity

    for elem in tup:
      if elem > max_value:
        max_value = elem
  return max_value
[END CODE]

Explanation:
- The function `find_max` is designed to find the maximum element from a list of tuples. Each tuple can contain any number of numeric elements.
- The variable `max_value` is initialized to negative infinity to ensure that any numeric value in the tuples will be larger.
- The function iterates over each tuple in the list and then over each element in the tuple. If an element is found that is greater than the current `max_value`, `max_value` is updated to this new value.
- After all elements have been checked, the function returns `max_value`, which is the maximum value found in all the tuples.
