Input: S: a list of elements, step: an integer indicating the step size
Output: result: a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list, starting from the first element and then every nth element

1: Initialize an empty list called result to store the sublists
2: For each index i from 0 to step-1 (inclusive):
3:     Initialize an empty list called temp to store the elements for the current sublist
4:     For each index j from i to the length of S, incrementing by step:
5:         Append S[j] to temp
6:     Append temp to result
7: Return result
