Input: lst: a list of sublists
Output: max_sublist: the sublist with the maximum length

1: Initialize a variable `max_sublist` to store the sublist with the maximum length, initially set to an empty list.
2: Initialize a variable `max_length` to store the length of the longest sublist found so far, initially set to 0.
3: Loop through each sublist in `lst`:
   4: If the length of the current sublist is greater than `max_length`:
      5: Update `max_length` to the length of the current sublist.
      6: Update `max_sublist` to the current sublist.
7: After the loop, return `max_sublist`.
