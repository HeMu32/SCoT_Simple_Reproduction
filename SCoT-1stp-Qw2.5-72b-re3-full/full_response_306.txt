Input: a: a list of integers, n: the length of the list, index: the index up to which we consider the prefix, k: the index of the element that must be included in the subsequence.
Output: The maximum sum of an increasing subsequence from the prefix till the ith index and including the kth element.

1: Initialize a list `dp` of size `n` with all elements set to 0. This list will store the maximum sum of increasing subsequence ending at each index.
2: Set `dp[k]` to the value of `a[k]` since the kth element must be included.
3: Loop through the list from the beginning up to the `index` (inclusive).
4:     For each element at position `i`:
5:         If `i` is less than `k`:
6:             Loop through all elements from the start up to `i` (exclusive).
7:                 If the current element `a[j]` is less than `a[i]`:
8:                     Update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + a[i]`.
9:         Else if `i` is equal to `k`:
10:             Continue to the next iteration since `dp[k]` is already set.
11:         Else:
12:             Break the loop as we only need to consider elements up to the `index`.
13: Return the value of `dp[k]` which represents the maximum sum of the increasing subsequence including the kth element.

### Explanation:
The function `max_sum_increasing_subseq` is designed to find the maximum sum of an increasing subsequence that ends at the `k`th index and includes all elements up to the `index`th position. The dynamic programming approach is used here to keep track of the maximum sum of increasing subsequences ending at each index. The `dp` array is initialized to store these sums, and the value at `dp[k]` is set to `a[k]` since the kth element must be included in the subsequence. The nested loops ensure that we only consider valid increasing subsequences, and the final result is the value stored at `dp[k]`.
