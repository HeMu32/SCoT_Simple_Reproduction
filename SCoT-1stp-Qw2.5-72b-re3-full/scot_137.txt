Input: nums: a list of integers
Output: ratio: the ratio of zeroes in the list
1: Initialize a variable zero_count to 0 to keep track of the number of zeroes
2: Initialize a variable total_count to the length of the list to represent the total number of elements
3: Loop through each element in the list:
4:     If the element is 0, increment zero_count by 1
5: Calculate the ratio of zeroes by dividing zero_count by total_count
6: Return the ratio
