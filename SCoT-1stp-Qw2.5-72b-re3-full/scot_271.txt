Input: n: an integer representing the number of first even natural numbers to consider.
Output: sum: an integer representing the sum of the fifth power of the first n even natural numbers.

1: Initialize a variable sum to 0 to store the cumulative sum.
2: Loop through each integer i from 1 to n inclusive.
3:     Calculate the even number as 2 * i.
4:     Calculate the fifth power of the even number.
5:     Add the fifth power to the sum.
6: After the loop, return the sum.
