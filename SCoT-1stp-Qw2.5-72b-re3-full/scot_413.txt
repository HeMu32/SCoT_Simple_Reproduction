Input: list1: a list of tuples, n: an integer representing the index of the element to extract from each tuple
Output: A list containing the nth element from each tuple in the given list

1: Initialize an empty list called result to store the nth elements.
2: Loop through each tuple in list1.
3:     For each tuple, check if the tuple has at least n+1 elements to avoid index out-of-range errors.
4:     If the tuple has enough elements, append the nth element to result.
5: After the loop, return the result list.
