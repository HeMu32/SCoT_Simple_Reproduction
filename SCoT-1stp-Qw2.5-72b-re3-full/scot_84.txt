Input: n: an integer representing the position in the Newman-Conway sequence
Output: The n-th number in the Newman-Conway sequence

The Newman-Conway sequence is defined as follows:
- P(1) = 1
- P(2) = 1
- For all n > 2, P(n) = P(P(n - 1)) + P(n - P(n - 1))

1: If n is 1 or 2, return 1 (base cases)
2: Initialize a list `seq` with the first two elements of the sequence [1, 1]
3: For i from 3 to n:
4:     Calculate the next element in the sequence using the formula P(i) = P(P(i - 1)) + P(i - P(i - 1))
5:     Append the calculated value to `seq`
6: Return the n-th element of `seq`
