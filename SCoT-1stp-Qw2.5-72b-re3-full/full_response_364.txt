Input: str: a binary string (string containing only '0's and '1's)
Output: The minimum number of flips required to make the string alternate in characters.

1: Initialize two counters, flip0 and flip1, to 0. These will count the number of flips needed if the string starts with '0' and '1' respectively.
2: Loop through each character in the string:
3:     If the index of the character is even:
4:         If the character is '1', increment flip0 (since we expect '0' at even indices for a string starting with '0').
5:         If the character is '0', increment flip1 (since we expect '1' at even indices for a string starting with '1').
6:     If the index of the character is odd:
7:         If the character is '0', increment flip0 (since we expect '1' at odd indices for a string starting with '0').
8:         If the character is '1', increment flip1 (since we expect '0' at odd indices for a string starting with '1').
9: Return the minimum of flip0 and flip1, as this will be the minimum number of flips required to make the string alternate.

### Explanation:
The function `min_flip_to_make_string_alternate` calculates the minimum number of flips required to make a binary string alternate in characters. The string can start with either '0' or '1', and the function considers both scenarios to determine the minimum number of flips needed.

- `flip0` counts the number of flips needed if the string starts with '0'.
- `flip1` counts the number of flips needed if the string starts with '1'.

The function iterates through the string, checking each character based on its index (even or odd) and increments the appropriate flip counter. Finally, it returns the minimum of the two flip counts, which represents the minimum number of flips required to achieve an alternating string.
